{"id":"bd-1eo","title":"Phase 3: Polish & Store Readiness — Paid App Quality","description":"# Epic: Polish & Store Readiness\n\n## Purpose\nTransform the functional app into a polished, premium experience worthy of the paid price point. This phase handles onboarding, downloads, accessibility, localization, visual polish, and store submission.\n\n## Why This Phase Matters\nA paid app must feel polished from the first second. Users who paid $5-10 expect:\n- Clear onboarding that builds trust\n- Beautiful, consistent visual design\n- Accessibility for all users\n- Reliable offline behavior with clear messaging\n- No dead-ends, broken states, or janky UI\n\nThis phase is what separates \"it works\" from \"I'm glad I bought this.\"\n\n## What Gets Built\n\n### 1. Onboarding Flow\nFirst-run experience (60-90 seconds, skippable, re-runnable from Settings):\n1. Language + home currency picker\n2. Offline promise screen (what works offline vs online)\n3. Downloads picker (optional packs with sizes)\n4. Offline Readiness Check (validation + \"Test in Airplane Mode\")\n5. Quick demo: Quote → Action with taxi example\n6. Privacy + Permissions explainer (no accounts, no ads, no data selling)\n\n### 2. Settings & Diagnostics\n- SettingsView with all user preferences\n- DownloadsView (pack manager with progress, pause/resume/cancel)\n- DiagnosticsView (content version, sync status, storage usage, offline readiness)\n- Privacy Center (plain-language data explanation)\n- Exchange rate manual entry\n- Wi-Fi only download toggle\n\n### 3. Downloads System\nTreat downloads as a product surface:\n- DownloadService with background capability\n- Pack manifest handling with dependencies\n- Progress tracking (determinate, not spinner)\n- Pause/resume/cancel with state persistence\n- Verification (sha256) before installation\n- Atomic install with rollback support\n- Clear error messages with recovery actions\n\n### 4. Offline UX Polish\nEvery screen follows the standard state model:\n- loading → skeleton/placeholder (never blank)\n- content → normal display\n- refreshing → subtle progress over content\n- offline → cached content + clear messaging\n- error → explanation + next action (Retry/Downloads/Work offline)\n\n### 5. Accessibility\nBoth platforms must pass accessibility audits:\n- VoiceOver (iOS) / TalkBack (Android) on core flows\n- Dynamic type / font scaling\n- Touch targets (iOS ≥44pt, Android ≥48dp)\n- Correct focus order\n- Sufficient contrast ratios\n- RTL readiness for Arabic text\n\n### 6. Localization\n- EN strings for both platforms\n- FR strings for both platforms (UI only, content stays EN for v1)\n- Locale-aware date/number/currency formatting\n- Safe fallback to EN if translation missing\n\n### 7. Visual Design Polish\nImplement the Marrakech visual identity:\n- Terracotta color palette (warm clay/earth tones)\n- Islamic geometric patterns (subtle, not distracting)\n- Consistent design tokens across platforms\n- Dark mode with warm identity (not generic blue/purple)\n- Share card design for screenshots/social\n\n### 8. Store Readiness\n- App Store screenshots (showing offline, pricing, navigation)\n- Play Store screenshots\n- Store descriptions emphasizing value\n- What's new content from content changelog\n- App Store video (optional but valuable)\n\n## Quality Gates\nBefore store submission:\n- Offline smoke test passes (airplane mode immediately after install)\n- Accessibility audit passes\n- All localized strings present\n- Dark mode verified\n- Performance budgets met (cold start <2s, search <100ms)\n- No forbidden permissions (contacts, photos)\n\n## Technical Components\n\n### Views/Screens\n- OnboardingFlow (multi-step)\n- SettingsView, DownloadsView, DiagnosticsView\n- Privacy Center\n\n### Services\n- DownloadService (iOS: URLSession background, Android: OkHttp + WorkManager)\n- ContentSyncService (manifest check, atomic swap)\n\n### Components\n- SkeletonView, OfflineBanner, ErrorState\n- ProgressIndicator (determinate)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- First-time user understands value within 60 seconds\n- App works beautifully in airplane mode\n- Downloads are reliable and resumable\n- Accessibility users can complete core flows\n- Visual design feels premium and culturally appropriate\n- Store pages clearly communicate the value\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: Phase 0 Foundation\n- Requires: Phase 1 Core Features (what we're polishing)\n- Requires: Phase 2 Location Features (for complete experience)\n- Blocks: Store submission","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:24:14.221524009Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:39:27.148754096Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-1eo","depends_on_id":"bd-37x","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:39:27.148736570Z","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

{"id":"bd-1s9","title":"Shared Content Pipeline — JSON to SQLite Transformation","description":"# Feature: Shared Content Pipeline\n\n## Purpose\nCreate the build system that transforms human-authored JSON content into the SQLite database that both iOS and Android apps consume. This is the single source of truth for all app content.\n\n## Why It Matters\n- Content editors work with readable JSON files\n- Both platforms get identical, validated content\n- Changes are caught before reaching users (schema validation)\n- Internal links are verified (no broken references)\n\n## Location\nAll pipeline code lives in shared/ directory:\n- shared/schema/ — JSON Schema definitions\n- shared/scripts/ — TypeScript build scripts\n- shared/content/ — Source JSON files\n- Output: content.db goes to ios/.../ and android/.../\n\n## Components to Build\n\n### 1. JSON Schema (shared/schema/content-schema.json)\nDefine strict schemas for:\n- places (with all fields from plan.md)\n- price_cards (expected costs, modifiers, scripts)\n- glossary (Darija phrases with Arabic/Latin/English)\n- itineraries (with step references)\n- tips (safety, scam awareness)\n- culture (etiquette do/don't)\n\n### 2. Validation Script (shared/scripts/validate-content.ts)\n- Load all JSON from shared/content/\n- Validate against schema (catch type errors, missing required fields)\n- Enforce invariants: unique IDs, valid coordinates, price min≤max\n- Require updatedAt/reviewedAt dates\n- Exit 0 on success, non-zero with clear errors on failure\n\n### 3. Build Bundle Script (shared/scripts/build-bundle.ts)\n- Read validated JSON\n- Create SQLite database with correct schema\n- Populate all content tables\n- Build FTS5 tables (prebuilt, not at runtime)\n- Generate content_links table from cross-references\n- Output content.db\n\n### 4. Link Checker Script (shared/scripts/check-links.ts)\n- Verify itinerary steps reference valid place IDs\n- Verify tip related_place_ids exist\n- Verify price card relationships are valid\n- Fail build if any broken references\n\n### 5. Seed Content\nMinimal but representative content for development:\n- 5 places (mix of landmarks, restaurants)\n- 5 price cards (taxi, hammam, souk basics)\n- 20 phrases (greetings, bargaining, emergencies)\n- 1 itinerary (single day)\n- 5 tips (common scams, etiquette basics)\n\n## Technical Stack\n- TypeScript for scripts (type safety, good tooling)\n- better-sqlite3 or similar for SQLite generation\n- ajv or zod for JSON validation\n- Node.js runtime\n\n## Success Criteria\n- npm run validate passes on all content\n- npm run build produces content.db\n- npm run check-links finds no broken references\n- Generated DB has all tables with correct schema\n- FTS tables are populated and searchable\n- Both platforms can load the same content.db\n\n## Integration Points\n- iOS: Copy content.db to ios/MarrakechGuide/Resources/SeedData/\n- Android: Copy content.db to android/app/src/main/assets/seed/\n- CI: Run validation + build on every PR\n\n## File Outputs\n- shared/schema/content-schema.json\n- shared/scripts/validate-content.ts\n- shared/scripts/build-bundle.ts\n- shared/scripts/check-links.ts\n- shared/scripts/package.json\n- content.db (generated, not committed)","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:25:05.890949201Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:25:05.895270794Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-1s9","depends_on_id":"bd-3lc","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:25:05.895237124Z","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

{"id":"bd-34f","title":"Phase 1: Core Features — The Heart of the Product","description":"# Epic: Core Features\n\n## Purpose\nBuild the features that deliver the core value proposition: helping tourists navigate Marrakech with confidence about prices, culture, and language. This phase produces the \"minimum lovable product.\"\n\n## Why This Phase Matters\nThis is where the app earns its price. The Quote → Action feature alone can save tourists from overpaying dozens of times. The Phrasebook reduces anxiety. The Explore/Eat features give curated, trustworthy recommendations instead of overwhelming TripAdvisor noise.\n\n## What Gets Built\n\n### 1. Content Display Features\n- **Explore**: Browse curated places with filters, map/list toggle, detail views\n- **Eat**: Curated restaurants with tags (budget, rooftop, family-friendly)\n- **Prices**: Price card categories and detailed pricing info with negotiation scripts\n- **Phrasebook**: Darija glossary with Arabic/Latin/English, RTL support, search\n- **Itineraries**: Pre-built day plans users can follow\n- **Tips & Culture**: Practical safety tips, etiquette guides, scam awareness\n\n### 2. The Killer Feature: Quote → Action\nThe instant price fairness check that justifies the app purchase:\n- User selects category (taxi, hammam, souk item, etc.)\n- User enters quoted price in MAD\n- App shows fairness meter (Low / Fair / High / Very High)\n- App provides adjusted range with context modifiers (night, peak season)\n- App gives counter-offer suggestions and negotiation scripts\n- Everything works offline, deterministically\n\n### 3. Search\nGlobal full-text search across all content types (places, prices, phrases, tips).\nMust be fast (<100ms), work offline, and handle Arabic/Latin normalization.\n\n### 4. User State\n- Favorites (save items for later)\n- Recently viewed (quick access to what user looked at)\n- Both stored in user.db, synced never (privacy-first)\n\n## Technical Components\n\n### Repositories (Data Access Layer)\nEach content type gets a repository with standard CRUD + specialized queries:\n- PlaceRepository, PriceCardRepository, PhraseRepository\n- ItineraryRepository, TipRepository, CultureRepository\n- FavoritesRepository, RecentsRepository\n\n### Engines (Business Logic)\n- **PricingEngine**: The Quote → Action brain. Inputs: priceCard, quotedMAD, modifiers. Outputs: fairnessLevel, adjustedRange, counterOffer, scripts.\n\n### Search Service\n- FTS5 (iOS) / FTS4 (Android) integration\n- Normalization for Arabic/Latin text\n- Ranking: exact > alias > prefix > contains\n\n## Success Criteria\n- User can browse all content types with filters\n- User can search and find relevant results in <100ms\n- Quote → Action returns correct fairness assessment for test vectors\n- User can save favorites and see recents\n- All features work in airplane mode\n- iOS and Android show identical content and behavior\n\n## Platform Parity\nCritical that both platforms implement the same:\n- PricingEngine logic (test with shared vectors)\n- Search normalization\n- UI flows and information architecture\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: Phase 0 Foundation (content pipeline, DB setup, app shells)\n- Blocks: Phase 2 Location Features (needs places for Go Home destinations)\n- Blocks: Phase 3 Polish (needs features to polish)","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:23:13.865889381Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:39:27.001778742Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-34f","depends_on_id":"bd-3lc","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:39:27.001754986Z","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}
{"id":"bd-37x","title":"Phase 2: Location Features — Confidence in the Moment","description":"# Epic: Location Features\n\n## Purpose\nBuild the location-aware features that provide confidence \"in the moment\" — when the tourist is actually out in Marrakech, potentially lost, potentially being quoted a price, and needs immediate help.\n\n## Why This Phase Matters\nThese features are the \"confidence companion\" promise made real:\n- **Home Base Compass**: \"I'm lost in the Medina but I can always find my way back\"\n- **My Day Planner**: \"I don't have to plan — the app gives me a realistic day\"\n- **Route Cards**: \"I can follow itineraries step-by-step without getting lost\"\n\nThese are high-perceived-value features that differentiate from generic travel guides.\n\n## What Gets Built\n\n### 1. Location Services\nFoundation for all location-aware features:\n- **iOS**: CoreLocation wrapper with proper lifecycle management\n- **Android**: FusedLocationProviderClient wrapper\n- **Both**: Request only when needed, stop when screen closes, respect battery\n\n### 2. Heading Services\nFor compass arrow direction:\n- **iOS**: CLLocationManager heading updates\n- **Android**: SensorManager with TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR\n- **Both**: Throttle UI updates to 10-20Hz, surface accuracy/confidence\n\n### 3. GeoEngine\nPure utility functions (no platform dependencies):\n- haversine(point1, point2) → distance in meters\n- bearing(from, to) → degrees\n- relativeAngle(bearing, heading) → arrow rotation\n- Shared test vectors to ensure iOS/Android produce identical results\n\n### 4. Home Base Compass\nThe \"Go Home\" feature:\n- User sets their riad/hotel once (HomeBaseSetup)\n- GoHomeView shows compass arrow pointing home + distance\n- Large-text taxi driver card (Arabic + Latin address)\n- Works fully offline\n- Manual refresh button\n- Heading confidence indicator (good/weak/unavailable)\n\n### 5. My Day Planner (PlanEngine)\nOffline daily plan builder:\n- User picks constraints: time (2-10h), pace, budget tier, interests\n- PlanEngine generates 3-7 stop itinerary\n- Avoids closed places (when structured hours available)\n- Prefers geographically coherent routes (minimize backtracking)\n- Output feeds into Route Cards\n\n### 6. Route Cards (RouteEngine)\nStep-by-step guidance for following itineraries:\n- Route overview (all stops, total time estimate)\n- Next stop view (name, distance, bearing, walk time estimate)\n- Compass arrow to destination\n- Mark as done → advance to next\n- Progress persisted across app restarts\n- Medina Mode fallback (simplified guidance when GPS unreliable)\n\n## Privacy Guarantees\n- Location is foreground-only (never background in v1)\n- Used only on-device while compass/route screens are open\n- No backend receives location data\n- Denial of permission keeps app fully usable (just without these features)\n\n## Battery Considerations\n- Start with balanced accuracy, escalate only on explicit refresh\n- Automatic timeout if screen left active too long\n- Stop updates immediately when screen closes\n- Throttle UI updates regardless of sensor frequency\n\n## Technical Components\n\n### Services\n- LocationService (iOS: CoreLocation, Android: FusedLocation)\n- HeadingService (iOS: CLLocationManager, Android: SensorManager)\n\n### Engines\n- GeoEngine (cross-platform math utilities)\n- PlanEngine (My Day generation logic)\n- RouteEngine (route progress + leg calculations)\n\n### Views/Screens\n- HomeBaseSetupView, GoHomeView, CompassArrowView\n- MyDayView, ConstraintPickerView\n- RouteOverviewView, NextStopView\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Compass accurately points to Home Base location\n- My Day generates sensible plans for given constraints\n- Route Cards guide user through itinerary reliably\n- Battery drain is reasonable during extended use\n- All features work offline\n- Permission denial gracefully degrades (app still usable)\n- iOS and Android produce identical GeoEngine outputs\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: Phase 0 Foundation (app shells, DB)\n- Requires: Phase 1 Core (places for destinations, itineraries for routes)\n- Blocks: None (but enhances overall product value)","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:23:42.575826952Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:39:27.082686520Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-37x","depends_on_id":"bd-34f","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:39:27.082671818Z","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

This includes the shared content pipeline (JSON → SQLite) and the basic app shells for both iOS and Android platforms.\n\n## Why This Comes First\nEverything in this app depends on content. The Quote → Action feature needs price cards. The Explore feature needs places. The Phrasebook needs glossary phrases. Without a working content pipeline, no feature can be built or tested properly.\n\nSimilarly, without the basic app shells (navigation, database setup, theming), there's nowhere to put the features.\n\n## Key Deliverables\n1. **Shared Content Pipeline** (in shared/)\n   - JSON Schema for all content types (places, price_cards, glossary, etc.)\n   - Validation script that catches schema violations before they reach the app\n   - Build script that transforms JSON → SQLite content.db\n   - Link checker that validates internal references (itinerary steps → places, tips → price_cards)\n   - Seed content for development (minimal but representative)\n\n2. **iOS Foundation** (in ios/)\n   - Xcode project with correct structure\n   - GRDB.swift integration for SQLite\n   - DatabaseManager handling content.db + user.db separation\n   - Basic theme tokens (Marrakech terracotta palette)\n   - Tab navigation shell (5 tabs: Home, Explore, Eat, Prices, More)\n   - Reusable components library started\n\n3. **Android Foundation** (in android/)\n   - Gradle project with Kotlin/Compose\n   - Room integration for SQLite\n   - DatabaseManager mirroring iOS structure\n   - Material 3 theme with Marrakech identity\n   - Bottom navigation matching iOS tabs\n   - Reusable Compose components started\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Running node shared/scripts/validate-content.ts validates all JSON\n- Running node shared/scripts/build-bundle.ts produces content.db\n- iOS app launches with tab navigation and loads content from DB\n- Android app launches with bottom nav and loads content from DB\n- Both apps show identical content (proving the pipeline works)\n\n## Architectural Decisions Locked Here\n- Two-database architecture (content.db read-only swap, user.db read-write)\n- GRDB for iOS (excellent FTS5 support, Swift-native)\n- Room for Android (standard, well-documented, FTS4/5 support)\n- Shared JSON schema as single source of truth\n- Platform-native navigation (not cross-platform abstractions)\n\n## Dependencies\nNone — this is the root of the dependency tree.\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- Risk: Schema changes mid-project break existing content\n  - Mitigation: Schema versioning, validate-before-ship gates\n- Risk: iOS/Android DB implementations diverge\n  - Mitigation: Shared test vectors for critical queries","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:22:47.535986449Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:22:47.535986449Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

{"id":"bd-ofw","title":"Phase 4: Backend (Optional) — Convex for Content Updates","description":"# Epic: Backend with Convex\n\n## Purpose\nAdd optional backend capabilities for content updates without app releases, user feedback collection, and potential cross-device sync. This is explicitly optional — the app must remain fully functional without it.\n\n## Why This is Phase 4\nThe app's core value is offline-first. A backend is additive, never required. We defer this to:\n1. Prove the offline experience works first\n2. Avoid premature complexity\n3. Ship faster to start earning revenue\n4. Build based on real user feedback needs\n\n## What Gets Built (If We Proceed)\n\n### 1. Convex Schema\nTables for:\n- places, priceCards, glossaryPhrases, cultureArticles, itineraries, tips\n- contentVersions (version tracking with release notes, rollout percentage)\n- feedback (user-submitted corrections, no account required)\n- Optional: events (curated weekly list with auto-expiration)\n\n### 2. Content Sync\n- Manifest-based versioning with signed bundles\n- Client checks contentVersions.latest\n- Downloads new bundle if newer version available\n- Verifies signature (Ed25519) and sha256\n- Atomic DB swap with rollback on failure\n- Rebuild FTS tables after swap\n\n### 3. Feedback System\nLow-friction \"Was this accurate?\" flow:\n- Stored locally in feedback outbox\n- Uploaded when online (no account required)\n- Quick reasons: closed/moved/hours wrong/price wrong/tourist-trap/other\n- Helps maintain content quality\n\n### 4. Optional Events Feed\nCurated \"What's on this week\":\n- Small JSON feed with expiresAt timestamps\n- Cached for brief offline use\n- Hidden gracefully if unavailable\n- Never blocks core functionality\n\n## Security Considerations\n- Signed manifest (Ed25519) with pinned public key\n- Replay protection (reject manifests older than last accepted)\n- Verify signature before download, sha256 after download\n- Never trust unverified content\n\n## Implementation by Platform\n\n### iOS\n- ContentSyncService using URLSession\n- Background download support\n- Signature verification with CryptoKit\n- Atomic swap with FileManager.replaceItemAt\n\n### Android\n- ContentSyncService using OkHttp + WorkManager\n- Signature verification with java.security\n- Atomic swap with File.renameTo()\n\n## What NOT to Build\n- User accounts (keep anonymous/offline-first)\n- Cloud favorites sync (defer to later version)\n- Real-time features (push notifications, live chat)\n- Analytics SDK (privacy-first)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Content updates deploy without app release\n- Users see \"What's new\" after update\n- Feedback submissions reach backend\n- Security: no unsigned content accepted\n- Offline experience unchanged (backend unavailable = still works)\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: Phase 0-3 complete (backend is frosting, not cake)\n- Blocks: Nothing (this is optional enhancement)\n\n## Decision Point\nEvaluate at end of Phase 3 whether to proceed:\n- Is content changing frequently enough to need updates?\n- Do we have bandwidth to maintain backend?\n- Is user feedback actually needed for content quality?\n\nIf answers are no, skip this phase and ship more content instead.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:24:39.006020965Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:39:27.217130787Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-ofw","depends_on_id":"bd-1eo","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-07T22:39:27.217106821Z","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}
