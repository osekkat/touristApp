The Journey
Begins Here
Marrakesh has been drawing in crowds
for centuries, from the time of caravans
crossing Saharan sands to trade gold and
salt. It’s still dazzling visitors, with the
razzamatazz of Djemaa El Fna, museums
grand and small, glorious riads,
entrancing souqs, tranquil gardens, a
vibrant food scene and a dash of new city
glamour. Despite the city suffering some
damage in the 2023 earthquake, repairs
are mostly complete, and Marrakesh has
emerged refreshed and vibrant. Dive in!

Manners Matter

Dress conservatively: cover
shoulders and knees (men and
women). If you wear form-fitting
leggings, cover them with a long top.
There’s no need for women to cover
their hair.
● Always say hello before asking for
something.
● Don’t drink alcohol in the street.
● If you’re bringing food to eat on a
train or bus journey, buy a bit extra
so you can offer some to your fellow
passengers.
● Avoid eating and drinking in public
during Ramadan.
●

Drinking in Marrakesh

Most medina cafes and restaurants
don’t serve alcohol, but you will find it
in some that cater mostly to tourists.
In the Ville Nouvelle, many restaurants
do serve alcohol and there are a few
bars. But drinking is kept discreet – you

can’t drink outside at pavement cafes
unless they’re screened from the road.
Usually, it’s Moroccan wines and beers
that are on offer.

Things to Know

Snacks Streetside snacking is a way
of life in Marrakesh, so don’t be afraid
to jump in. Busy souq workers with
no time for a long lazy lunch head
to a snak (street stall) to feast on
peppery merguez (spicy sausage),
teyhan (stuffed spleen) and brochettes
(kebabs). Hot spots in the medina
(besides Djemaa El Fna) include just
south of Place Ben Youssef in the
souqs, Rue de la Kasbah and the
western end of Rue Bab Doukkala.
Small change Keep a ready supply of
Dh5 and Dh10 coins and Dh20 notes
at the ready for tips, bottles of water
or cab fares. No taxi driver wants to
be confronted with a Dh200 note,
especially first thing in the morning.

TIP
There’s a favourite trick in Marrakesh where young men riding pillion on

PLAN YOUR TRIP

STEPHANE C

When To Go
Any time is a good time to visit Marrakesh, with the possible exception
of July and August, when temperatures soar to 50°C or more.
End-of-year holidays are peak season, when many riads and hotels ask
for a minimum of three to five nights’ stay. It might be chilly, but it’s
warmer than Europe and skies are usually blue. Easter and All Saints
(end October) are also peak times, when European schools are on holiday.
Spring (March–May) and autumn (September–October) are busy, and the
weather is perfect. The summer months of July to August have extreme
temperatures and you’ll need to stay hydrated and out of the sun.

Big City Events

January: Run from Djemaa El
Fna to the Palmeraie and back
in the Marrakesh Marathon
(marathon-marrakech.com) each
January.
February: The Marrakech
International Storytelling
Festival (worldstorytellingcafe.
com) brings almost a hundred
storytellers to the city every
February. Events take place all over
the medina, including the World
Storytelling Café, Dar Bellarj, Cafe
Clock and Riad Star.

July: The only thing hotter than
Marrakesh in July is the free-form
National Festival of Popular Art.
Amazigh musicians, dancers and
street performers from around the
country pour into Marrakesh to
thrill the masses.
November: Marrakesh’s longrunning International Film
Festival (marrakech-festival.com)
takes place every November. It
gathers national and international
filmmakers, actors and directors for
special screenings and workshops
at venues across the city, including

WHEN TO GO

the Musée Yves Saint Laurent
Marrakech. During the weeklong
festival, film projections are beamed
onto Djemaa El Fna.

Ramadan & Eid
Visiting Morocco during the month
of Ramadan is a wonderful
opportunity to gain a glimpse into
local life, and to try the delicious
fare on offer for ftour (breakfast)
served at sunset. Ramadan dates
change each year according to the
Islamic calendar.
Moroccans fast from sunrise to
sunset. While non-Muslims need
not fast, avoid eating and drinking

on the street. Banks and post
offices change their hours, time
reverts to GMT/UTC and medina
shops only get going around 11am.
Restaurants aimed at tourists
remain open all day and breakfast
at your accommodation is served
as normal.
Eid El Fitr is a one- or two-day
holiday celebrating the end of
Ramadan. Eid El Adha is a five-day
holiday held roughly two months
after Ramadan, when families
slaughter a sheep, most things
are closed and public transport
is affected.

ACCOMMODATION LOWDOWN
If you visit during the week and out of peak season, you’ll find lower prices at all
types of accommodation. Bargains can be had during July and August, but make
sure you have air-conditioning and a pool to help cope with the heat.

PLAN YOUR TRIP
GETTING THERE

Getting There
Most people arrive at Marrakesh Menara Airport or at Marrakesh
Train Station, both in the Ville Nouvelle. There are also good bus
connections from all parts of the country.

From the Airport to the City Centre
By Taxi
Order a taxi in advance (order.kech.
cab), or go to the yellow and black
kiosk outside the airport doors. The
cost is Dh87 for a petit taxi from the
airport to Djemaa El Fna (for up to
three people) or Dh107 for a grand
taxi (for four to six people or extra
luggage such as a surfboard).

By Private Transfer
Unless you know exactly where
you are going, it’s much easier (and
only slightly more expensive) to ask
your accommodation to send a taxi
to meet your flight. This way, the
driver will drop you at the medina

entrance nearest your hotel or riad,
and staff will come to meet you and
help you with your luggage.

By Airport Bus 19
The bus runs a circular route, every
30 minutes, between the airport
and central Marrakesh. It departs
across the car park opposite the
arrivals hall and stops at Arset El
Bilk (a one-minute walk to Djemaa
El Fna) and then runs along Ave
Mohammed V via Bab Nkob
(alight for Bab Doukkala) to Gueliz
(passing Place du 16 Novembre and
the train station) before heading
back to the airport.

Other Points of Entry
Bus Stations
Marrakesh has three bus stations. CTM and
Supratour buses arrive and depart Marrakesh
from their own stations, situated close to each
other in the suburb of Gueliz (walking distance
from the train station). There’s also the gare
routière (bus station) at Bab Doukkala on the
eastern edge of the medina.
Taxis wait outside both the CTM and
Supratour stations. Expect to pay Dh20 to Dh50
28 to Djemaa El Fna.

-getting-there-pk-mar7-output.indd 28

Marrakesh
Train Station

Marrakesh’s modern
train station is big,
organised and
convenient. Taxis
wait outside. City bus
10 runs to Djemaa El
Fna roughly every 20
minutes between
6am and 10pm.

6/20/2025 9:52:55 AM

Tuk Tuk
These are small enough to ply
medina streets and are particularly
good when you get tired or if you
think you’ll get quite lost. Tuk
Tuk Marrakech is a city initiative
providing employment for people
with disability and some vehicles
are electric. Hire one on Djemaa
El Fna or WhatsApp Rachida
(0641887553) for a pick-up.

Taxi
Getting a taxi in Marrakesh has
improved and most drivers use their
meter (ask if they don’t put it on).
Avoid taking taxis from stands that
get a lot of tourist business (the
airport, train station, major hotels,
Jardin Majorelle and virtually all
those around the medina gates),
as they are not obliged to use their

-getting-around-pk-mar7-output.indd 29

GETTING AROUND

Compact and flat, Marrakesh was made for walking. The medina’s
skinny maze of souqs and alleys can only be explored on foot.
Pavements are cobbled with the odd pothole; wear sturdy shoes.
Watch out for speeding motorbikes. Gueliz is laid out like a European
city, with pavements for walking, but they can be uneven here, too. Be
careful crossing roads, as drivers don’t necessarily stop at crossings.

Getting Around

meters. You can get a better price by
flagging a taxi down on the street.
Note that petits taxis might take
multiple fares at the same time (the
meter is programmed to work out
who owes what). If you’re trying to
hail a taxi from the road, you can
theoretically flag down any taxi as
long as it has fewer than three passengers already inside. The driver

will ask where you’re going, and
if it’s in the same direction as the
other passengers, he should let you
jump in. To flag one down, stand
on the side of the street with traffic
flowing towards your destination.
If your party numbers more than
three, you must take a grand taxi.
Journeys within the city cost Dh50,
but, again, more if you take one
from a taxi rank.
You can only pay taxis, both petit
and grand, in cash. Try to have a
reasonable amount of change so
you don’t present the driver with a
Dh200 note.

Bus
The main medina bus stop is on the
western side of Arset El Bilk, the
garden next to Djemaa El Fna. Services start around 6am and finish
between 9.30pm and 10pm, with
buses on most routes running every
15 to 20 minutes. Tickets cost Dh4;
buy on board using small change.

Calèche
These green horse-drawn carriages
congregate alongside Arset El Bilk
next to Djemaa El Fna and around

Jardin Majorelle. Bargain hard
on the cost: a good rate would be
around Dh250 for a 1½-hour tour,
but many tourists end up paying
double that.
You can dictate the route to an
extent, but a typical tour might
run from Jardin Majorelle to the
Kasbah and Mellah via Djemaa El
Fna, and around the ramparts.
Check the condition of the horse
before haggling for a ride as some
are better cared for than others.
Animal welfare charity SPANA
(spana.org) works with Marrakesh’s
calèche drivers, monitoring horse
welfare and maintaining water
troughs along popular carriage
routes, but horses need more shade
at Arset El Bilk.

Bicycle
This pancake-flat city is good
terrain for cyclists, but traffic is
a major problem: you’ll need to
be a confident rider to stomach
the medina hubbub. Good-quality
bicycles and helmets can be hired
from Marrakech Green Wheels
(marrakechgreenwheels.com) and
Pikala Bikes (p114).

Venturing Outside the City
North & South of the Medina
To visit Sidi Ghanem, the
Palmeraie art museums and
the Water Museum, talk to your
accommodation about hiring

a private driver. Expect to pay
Dh600/1000 per half/full day for
two to four people. You could also
negotiate a similar rate with a
grand taxi driver.

A Few Surprises
As you might expect in an ancient city full of tiny alleyways, Marrakesh
has a few surprises up its sleeve.
Behind the Wooden Door

A FEW SURPRISES

If you haven’t been to Morocco
before, you might start to wonder
where you’re going when you are led
down a narrow alleyway with blank
walls to your riad. The formidable
wooden door studded with large
black nails opens and you step
inside… Only when you turn the corner is all revealed: a courtyard open
to the sky, a floor of zellige (mosaic
tile), perhaps a central fountain,
orange trees, tall cedarwood doors,
carved plaster or painted wood.
While the decoration will differ, the
concept remains the same – nothing
of the owner’s wealth or family is
visible from the street.
When it comes to bedrooms,
you won’t get a balcony or a view.
Rooms are long and narrow because,
traditionally, Moroccans slept on
banquettes arranged around the
walls rather than on Western-style
beds. Windows look onto the central
courtyard and natural light comes
from the open roof. Climb up to the
rooftop for views over the medina
and across to the High Atlas Mountains. It’s up here that you might
be served breakfast, or soak up
the sun on loungers. Most riads in
Marrakesh have a pool, which might
32 be on the roof or in the courtyard.

-few-surprises-pk-mar7-output.indd 32

Once you have seen what lies
behind that thick wooden door, you
start to wonder what jewels are
hiding behind others. If you are not
staying in a riad, visit the Musée
de la Musique (p68) or have tea at
1112 Marrakech (p91) to discover
this local architecture.

Koutoubia Minaret
In an ordinary mosque, the muezzin
climbs the stairs inside the minaret
to give the call to prayer. But as the
Koutoubia Minaret (p49) is 77m
high, it was built (in 1195) with a
ramp on the inside to allow the
muezzin to ride a horse to the top.
From there, he called the faithful
to prayer from each cardinal point.
These days, he simply stays on the
ground floor and uses a microphone.
In 2016, the mosque was fitted with
solar panels, solar water heaters and
LED lights to make it more energy
efficient.

The Rich & Famous in Marrakesh
Film stars, politicians, musicians,
artists, sports stars and royalty
all seem to relish their time in
Marrakesh. The Red City has always
drawn the rich and famous, from
George Orwell in 1938, who was
horrified by the conditions that

wrote Mamunia in 1973. Depicted
in Inventing Anna (2022), the
notorious fraudster Anna Delvey
was a less welcome guest.

Museums in the Medina

A FEW SURPRISES

It’s remarkable that within the 11 sq
km of the medina, there are as many
as 15 museums, some run by the
National Foundation of Museums
and some private. They range from
the grand Musée de Marrakech
(p90) down to the tiny Musée du
Parfum (p115). Of note is that they
are all housed in gorgeous buildings
that are worth visiting in their own
right. Some are riads that were built
close to the Kasbah, home to the
Sultan, so that wealthy, influential

Moroccans lived in, to Winston
Churchill, who told Franklin D
Roosevelt that Marrakesh was the
loveliest place in the world. More
recently, the Duke and Duchess of
Sussex paid an official visit in 2019,
the Clintons attended a friend’s
birthday the same year, and the
UK’s Queen Camilla made a private
visit in 2025.
In the 100 years of its existence,
hotel La Mamounia (p56) has
seen many famous – and infamous
– characters through its doors. It

du Patrimoine Immatériel (p47)

housed the national bank; and the

(p91), which replaced the Orientalist
Museum and features 1300 years of
Moroccan costumes.

-few-surprises-pk-mar7-output.indd 34

Royal Palace
HRH King Mohammed VI has
official palaces in many Moroccan
cities. In Marrakesh, it’s in the
Kasbah (p95), which was originally
built by the Almohads after their
invasion in the 12th century. The
whole Kasbah neighbourhood
was a royal one, with the El Yazid
Mosque serving the sultan’s entourage. While we can’t visit Dar El
Makhzen (House of Government),
we know that the current palace
buildings and gardens were
constructed in the 18th century.
The King and his family use Dar El
Makhzen on visits to the city, and
also stay in a private part of the
nearby Palais Bahia (p98).

Although Morocco has its own
successful film industry, Marrakesh
has long served as a setting for
big-budget Hollywood productions.
Step inside the Musée du
Patrimoine Immatériel (p47) on
Djemaa El Fna where there is a
room dedicated to films and plays
set in or about the city. Posters from
the films decorate the walls. Here
you can see James Stewart and

PLAN YOUR TRIP

These large black and white birds
build huge, messy nests of sticks
on tall structures such as minarets
and microwave towers. The birds
return to Morocco after wintering
in southern Africa and delight
Moroccans, who view them as
bringing spring and good luck.
It’s against the law to harm one.
In Darija they’re called lak-lak,
echoing the noise they make with
their beaks, and in Arabic bellarj.
Dar Bellarj (p91), near the
Ben Youssef Medersa in Kâat Ben
Nahid, is an arts and cultural
centre, but once upon a time it
was a hospital for sick and injured
storks.
The best place to see storks in
Marrakesh is at the Badi Palace
(p104), where they enjoy the view
from the tall, red walls. To get up
close and personal, head to the
rooftop at Kosybar (p107) on Place
des Ferblantiers and share the
sunset with them over a glass of
Moroccan gris (rosé).

Getting Around
Walk
Djemaa El Fna is roughly in the centre of the
medina and most streets lead here. Anyone
can point you in the right direction to the
square if you ask (and sometimes if you
don’t). To get around this neighbourhood,
you’ll be on foot. The going is flat, but you do
have to watch out for motorbikes negotiating
their way through tiny streets, and men with
carts delivering goods. The pavements are
cobbled, so wear sturdy shoes.

T H E B E ST

DJEMAA EL FNA & SOUTHERN CENTRAL SOUQS

Roll up, roll up: if there’s one thing you can’t miss in Marrakesh,
it’s the reeling, free-wheeling circus that is Djemaa El Fna. By
day, piercing flutes and drums provide the soundscape, while
street vendors peddle incense and spices, fruit-juice stands
tout for business, shops display more baskets than you’ve ever
seen and motorbikes zoom round the edges. At night, hordes of
hungry revellers come to feast at food stalls and be entertained
by musicians and performers. Heading south, the parallel Riad
Zitoun streets and surrounding alleyways are crammed with
interesting shops.

Djemaa El Fna
The very heart of Marrakesh, Djemaa El Fna is fizzing with
energy from morning to night. By day, it buzzes with souvenir
stalls, fruit-juice stands, snake charmers and potion sellers.
Come evening, the square turns into an open-air food fair and
pulsates to the tune of exciting performers.
MAP P40 D3

PLANNING TIP
Come before
midday to
avoid crowds
of tourists. By
night, a food tour
might help you
navigate the food
stands. Climb to
cafe rooftops to
watch the action
from above.

Join the Carnival
on Djemaa El Fna
Welcome to the greatest show in town. Everywhere you look in Marrakesh’s main square, you’ll
discover drama in progress. It’s been this way for
almost a millennium: a hypnotic dance of hoopla,
halqa (street theatre) and food stalls, set to the
tune of gnaoua drums and snake charmers with
their piercing flutes.

History
Djemaa El Fna sprang into life in the 11th century,
around the time that the city of Marrakesh was
founded by the Almoravids. Historians and
locals will argue over whether the square got its
name from the fact that public executions were
likely held here: one translation is ‘assembly of
the dead’. Another translation is ‘mosque of the
dead’, which could be a nod to the partial collapse
of neighbouring Koutoubia Mosque in the 18th
century, burying worshippers inside.
For centuries, the square was used as a giant
food market, with traders flooding down from
the mountains to set up under canvas tents each
day. Early photos of this era are displayed in the

Morning Quiet
Stroll Djemaa El Fna as it wakes up to catch the
plaza at its least frenetic. At this point, the stage is
almost empty. Fruit-juice vendors are first on the
scene, along with the snake charmers and their
baskets of cobras. Incense and potion sellers and
henna-tattoo artists start setting up makeshift
stalls under sunshades.

Be warned:
you will see
chained monkeys
paraded for
tourists, and the
practices of the
snake charmers
are ethically
questionable.
They are not
on the square
at night.

Once the food stalls start setting up around 5pm,
the excitement begins to mount. At dusk, smoke
rises from the grills, and locals and visitors descend on the square for an entertaining night out.
It has always been like this – people gather to eat,
socialise and be entertained. In the beginning, the
square was where people heard the latest news
and tales of what was going on in the rest of the
country. The food stalls, often handed down from
father to son, are arranged in strict rows (though
not in numerical order), and everything is scrupulously clean. The food stalls are in the middle of
the square surrounded by the fruit-juice vendors,
and the entertainers are on the outer edges.
Approach it as the locals do: pick what you’d
like to eat in no particular order from various

Dinner…

DJEMAA EL FNA & SOUTHERN CENTRAL SOUQS

Spicy snail broth, skewered hearts, bubbling
tajines, flash-fried fish: the Djemaa El Fna food
stalls (p58) are a heaving one-stop shop for Moroccan culinary specialities, and they’re not to be
missed. Despite alarmist warnings, your stomach
should be fine, as hygiene requirements are scrupulously upheld. Clean your hands before eating, use
bread instead of utensils and stick to filtered water.
Stalls have numbered spots and are set up on
a grid. The snail chefs are in a line on the eastern
side. For fried fish and calamari, pull up a pew at
Stall 14. Look for lovely Aicha, who runs Stall 1 in
the southwestern corner, for brochettes (kebabs),
tajines and harira (a cheap, hearty soup made of
tomatoes, onions, saffron and coriander with lentils
and chickpeas).
After dinner, join locals at the row of copper tea
urns on the southern edge of the stalls. The speciality here is warming ginger tea called khoudenjal
with cinnamon, mace and cardamom, served with
a dense, sticky and similarly spicy scoop of cake – a
pit stop at Chez Mohammed, Stall No 71, is the
perfect way to round out your meal.

WHEN TO GO
Mid-morning is
the best time to
peruse the stalls
on the square in
comfort, avoiding
large crowds.
Food stalls start
operating around
sunset and you
can expect to
spend a couple
of hours eating,
watching the
entertainers,
and perhaps
taking a break on
a cafe rooftop.

stalls. You could grab a sandwich to go and wander
off to watch your favourite performers and then
come back for another course. The emphasis is on
good food and a fun night out.

…And a Show
A proper night out calls for entertainment. The
performers on Djemaa El Fna deliver wonder,
excitement, spectacle and old-fashioned fun.
People throng around and gawp and gaze, showing
their appreciation with a tip. Amazigh musicians
draw people nostalgic for their mountain villages.
Dancers in bright satin outfits spin and leap to
rhythmic gnaoua tunes played on the hajhooj
(three-stringed guitar), punctuated by castanets,

tassels flying. In another corner, men dressed as
belly dancers, with veils and glitzy fabrics tied
around their hips, shimmy for their audience.
Others try to win a bottle of soda with a fishing
pole, or have their palms read.
For centuries, Djemaa El Fna has been a
stage for musicians, whispering fortune-tellers,
amazing fire eaters and swallowers of boiling
water, cartwheeling acrobats and, above all,
hikayat (storytellers). Today, the last of the
storytellers have gone and with them many of the
square’s traditional performers. There are fears
about what is being lost: while Djemaa El Fna
has been a protected urban landmark since 1922
and UNESCO-inscribed since 2001 as a place of
unique cultural exchange, UNESCO has flagged
the square as a space under ‘serious threat’ from
urbanisation and cultural assimilation.

Who’s Who on the Square
Throughout the day and night on Djemaa El Fna,
you’ll come across brightly dressed water-carriers,

Models of various characters found on the
square are dressed in traditional costumes. There
are the water-carriers with their distinctive red
outfits, large, wide-brimmed hats, leather bags
studded with coins and metal mugs – you can
still see them today. There’s a scribe dressed in

for a customer. A Gnaoua musician is wearing
his traditional cowrie shells, about to play his
castenets.

Koutoubia Mosque

MAP P40 A5

The Mosque
Lying 500m southwest of Djemaa El Fna, this is
the largest of Marrakesh’s mosques and is hugely
important to Moroccans; its minaret is symbolic of
the city. When it was damaged in the 2023 earthquake, people looked on in horror as the minaret
listed slightly to one side. It has since been fully
restored.
This was not the first earthquake that the
mosque suffered. It is thought to have collapsed
during the massive 1755 Lisbon earthquake, killing
hundreds of people as it crumbled, possibly leading
to the name of Djemaa El Fna, which could be
translated as ‘mosque of the dead’. On the northwestern side of the minaret are the ruins of the
original 12th-century prayer hall, which can be
explored by everyone. To the north of the minaret,
the original doorway still stands. On the far wall
of the ruins, the remains of the arches that would
have held up the ceiling are visible. The stumps on
the floor are the hall’s columns, and they stay in
situ as a memorial.
The small, white-domed building close to the
road is the Koubba of Lalla Zohra, marking the
grave of Fatima Zohra bint al Kush, a mystic who
died in the early 17th century.

b-djemaa-el-fna-southern-central-souqs-pk-mar7-output.indd 49

PLANNING TIP
The mosque is
open only to
Muslims. NonMuslims have
the best chance
of a glimpse
inside when the
doors are open
for prayers on
a Friday.

Five times a day, one voice rises above the din of Djemaa El Fna
as the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer from the Koutoubia
Mosque. The mosque’s minaret stands guard over the old city
and is Marrakesh’s most famous landmark.

The Landmark Minaret
QUICK BREAK
Head to oldfashioned Café
El Koutoubia
(p60) across Ave
Mohammed V
and join the
locals for a pot of
mint tea on the
street terrace. It
has grand views
of the minaret.

Completed in 1195, the minaret soars 77m and
can be seen from many kilometres around. In
fact, its use went beyond the spiritual as it also
served as a lighthouse and watchtower, and no
high-rise buildings above the height of a palm
tree can be built around it.
The square sandstone structure, measuring
12.8m on each side, is decorated with pretty
multifoil arches, carved arabesques, green and
white zellige (geometric mosaic tilework) and
stepped merlons. Inside the tower is a ramp wide
enough for the muezzin to ride a horse to the
top, though today he uses a microphone for the
call to prayer. It’s the prototype for the Giralda in
Seville, Spain, and the Hassan Tower in Rabat.

WHAT’S IN A
NAME?
In the 19th
century,
booksellers
clustered around
the Koutoubia
Mosque’s base –
hence the name,
from kutubiyyin
(meaning
booksellers in
Arabic). Before
that time, it was
simply called
the Almohad
Mosque.

Koutoubia Gardens
Stretching out behind the Koutoubia Mosque,
the palm-tree-dotted green swath of Koutoubia
Gardens is a favourite spot for strolling, relaxing
on park benches and generally taking a quiet
break. If you need some downtime after dodging
motorbikes amid the medina’s narrow alleyways,
take the locals’ lead and head here for a peaceful
meander with great views of the minaret.

b-djemaa-el-fna-southern-central-souqs-pk-mar7-output.indd 51

PHOTOGENIC
MINARET
The best spot
from which to
photograph
the Koutoubia’s
minaret – framed
by old stone
and date palms
– is under the
archway to the
left of the main
entrance.

DJEMAA EL FNA & SOUTHERN CENTRAL SOUQS

The minaret is topped by a spire with three brass
globes in the Moorish style. Once made from gold,
local legend tells that the orbs were a gift to the
mosque by the wife of Almohad Sultan Yacoub
Al Mansour, who melted down her jewellery as
punishment after she was spotted eating during
Ramadan fasting hours.
Today, the orbs are filled with special mineral
salt from the High Atlas Mountains, which
includes nitrate and magnesium that prevents
the spire from oxidising. The salt is changed once
a year, during Ramadan, to maintain the golden
glint. In front of the spire, a wooden pole points
towards Mecca and is also used to bear flags on
religious holidays.
Another legend tells that the pious Almohads
had the original mosque razed halfway through
construction because the qibla, or wall that faces
Mecca, wasn’t properly aligned with the holy city.
Exact dates of construction are not clear.

Taste Mechoui Alley

STREET FOOD

Just before noon, the vendors at
this row of stalls (MAP: 1 P40 D2)
start carving up steaming sides of
mechoui (slow-roasted lamb). Very
little English is spoken, but simply
point to the best-looking cut of
meat, and ask for a nus (half) or
rubb (quarter) kilo. The cook will
hack off falling-from-the-bone lamb
and hand it to you with fresh-baked
bread, cumin and salt. Choose to
take away or eat at benches behind
the counter, beside the hot hole in
the floor where the lamb is cooked.
The alley’s southern entrance
is most famous for Chez Lamine
Hadj Mustapha (p58). The
speciality here is the paper-sealed
crockpots of tanjia, Morocco’s
famed ‘bachelor’s stew’. Use bread as
your utensil to scoop up the buttersoft meat.
Swerve round the corner to
tiny Souq Ableuh (MAP: 2 P40 D3),
dedicated to olives. Glistening green
olives, black olives, purple olives
and olives marinated in harissa – it’s
basically olive heaven. A dozen stalls
specialise in olives, capers, chillies,
preserved lemons and harissa.

was being readied in the same
neighbourhood, and was planned to
open late 2025 or early 2026.
You’ll be able, once again, to travel
to Timbuktu and back again via the
late Dutch anthropologist Bert
Flint’s art collection. Each exhibit
represents a caravan stop along the
Sahara–Marrakesh route, presenting indigenous crafts from Tuareg
camel saddles to High Atlas carpets,
and offering tantalising glimpses of
Marrakesh’s trading-post past.
Flint’s superb book detailing the
collection, African Berber Culture in
North Africa and the Sahel Region,
is available at the Jardin Majorelle
bookshop.

It’s worth exploring the old fanadiq
north of Djemaa El Fna at Bab

APPROPRIATE MEDINA ATTIRE
In Gueliz, shorts and tank tops are fine, but in the medina, where life remains more
traditional, your choice of attire may be perceived as a sign of respect for yourself
and Moroccans alike. For both men and women, this means not wearing shorts,
sleeveless tops or revealing clothing. If you do, some people will be embarrassed
for you and the family that raised you and avoid eye contact. So, if you don't want
to miss out on some excellent company – especially among older Moroccans –
dress modestly.

ART

If you’re in Marrakesh at the end
of January/beginning of February,
don’t miss the 1-54 Contemporary
African Art Fair (1​-54​.com/​
marrakech) held at La Mamounia
and DaDa Marrakesh, among other
venues. Founded in 2013 by Touria

b-djemaa-el-fna-southern-central-souqs-pk-mar7-output.indd 56

El Glaoui, there are three editions
per year: in London, New York and
Marrakesh. International galleries
specialising in contemporary African
art are featured, showcasing curated
selections of groundbreaking
contemporary pieces by both
emerging and established artists.
Artists’ talks, panel discussions and a
special projects programme are also
included. The fair’s name refers to
the 54 countries that constitute the
African continent.
An excellent resource for finding
out what’s happening in the art
world in Marrakesh is 1​-54​.com/​

Experience the Glamour
of La Mamounia

HOTEL

MAP: 7 P40 A6

Celebrities have been flocking to
the La Mamounia (mamounia.
com) for a hundred years. Winston
Churchill thought it a marvellous
place, and Alfred Hitchcock filmed
here. Presidents, movie stars,
politicians and couturiers visited.
The Rolling Stones holidayed
here in 1968, and Paul McCartney
composed Mamunia in 1973. Now
synonymous with Marrakesh, this
legendary hotel is intrinsic to the
city’s glamorous history.
Today the gardens, covering 8
hectares, are a tranquil spot for a
wander. They are lush and wellcared for, with plenty of birdlife
among the palm, olive and orange
trees, as well as lots of flowering
plants and interesting sculptures.

Marrakech

ART GALLERY

DaDa Marrakech (dadamarrakech.
com) is billed as a gathering space
for art, food, books and music.
Located on Djemaa El Fna, it has an
enormous gallery space and opened
just in time for 1-54 in January 2025.
It’s the brainchild of Kamal Laftimi,
who is behind many of Marrakesh’s
top restaurants, and was designed
by Ann Favier. Upstairs is the bar
and cantina with a fresh, grillfocused menu. On the ground
floor, Le Grand Palais (p58) offers
top-notch Moroccan traditional
cuisine in a highly decorated room.
The bookshop is also at ground level
and stocks beautiful, coffee-table art
books.

SHOPPING

MAP: 9 P40 D2

Souq Semmarine runs north from
Djemaa El Fna, wending its way
towards the Ben Youssef medersa
(school for studying the Quran).
It’s packed with tiny shops (and
crowds of shoppers), chock-full
of merchandise spilling onto the
street. You won’t find fancy concept
stores here, and the souvenirs are
aimed squarely at tourists. Spend an
hour or so browsing for babouches,
ceramics, caftans, djellaba
(traditional hooded garments) and
lighting – lanterns and pierced brass
lamp shades. Truth be told, much of
this merchandise has been made in
surrounding neighbourhoods where
it can be bought at more reasonable
prices if you’re prepared to delve
deeper into the souqs.
Visit in the early morning to
escape the heat, or in the evenings
as dusk falls and the lighting shops
are prettily illuminated.

you’re smartly dressed – you won’t
be allowed in otherwise.

JACQUES MAJORELLE AT LA MAMOUNIA
Orientalist painter Jacques Majorelle oversaw the original interior design of La
Mamounia, blending two trends: Amazigh artisanship and his beloved art deco.
He painted the dining room ceiling, with its exposed wooden beams, in a green
and yellow lozenge pattern that still graces what is now the Bar Majorelle, and
worked on much of the former reception area. He employed painters from Paris
and artisans from his home studio at what is now Jardin Majorelle (p122). For the
first revamp of the hotel in 1947, Majorelle again made major contributions. Today,
the hotel’s Majorelle Suite features a portrait of the artist.

MOUASSINE & CENTRAL SOUQS

The lanes that spool north from Djemaa El Fna sum up the
push and pull between the old and the new in Marrakesh. This
atmospheric area is home to the city’s biggest concentration of
souqs and qissariat (covered markets). You could spend a whole
morning exploring the spice shops around Rahba Kedima. In
artisan areas such as Souq Haddadine and the fanadiq (inns),
metalworkers clang away.
Mouassine has a fresh breed of Mediterranean-inspired
rooftop restaurants breathing fresh life into the ancient streets.
Dating from the 16th-century Saadian period, this wealthy area
had grand homes, and at the centre is the beautifully restored
Mouassine mosque.

Getting Around
The best route north from Djemaa El Fna is
to take Souq Semmarine up to Place Rahba
Kedima and beyond.
Car
There is no car access through the souqs.
The most convenient drop-off gateways are
Bab Laksour and Dar El Bacha.
Walk
Beyond the gateways you’ll be on foot in this
neighbourhood. Fortunately, it’s flat, but the
pavements are cobbled so be sure to have
suitable footwear. This is an ancient area and
streets are very narrow and get busy. Look
out for motorbikes.

Le Jardin Secret
The foundations of this historic riad are more than 400
years old. Here, though, it’s not the building so much as the
traditional Islamic garden that is so special. Fed by a restored
original khettara (underground irrigation system), the gardens
are a living museum to demonstrate the ancient waterworks.
MAP P64 E3

PLANNING TIP
Plan on an hour
or so exploring
the garden.
It makes an
excellent respite
from the bustle of
the medina and
the water cools
things down in
summer.

Scan this QR code for
full opening hours and
to book ahead.

-mouassine-central-souqs-pk-mar7-output.indd 66

The Riad
One of the most beautiful palaces in the medina,
Le Jardin Secret dates from Saadian times. It’s
a surprise to find such a large garden complex in
the middle of the busy medina. Two riads and their
gardens were joined around the time the palace
was constructed in 1850. Wander through the
unfurnished riad rooms with well-explained exhibits
on the site’s history, the importance of water and the
role of gardens in Moroccan culture.

The Water
High-tech screens use CGI to expertly show the
flow of water around the site, and a fascinating
documentary details the restoration process of the
complex. The water comes from the High Atlas
through an ingenious system of underground
drainage channels called khettaras, which is still in
use. Only rich families could afford a domestic water
supply instead of using communal fountains in the
streets, and Le Jardin Secret’s water supply was
shared with the local mosque. Channels, pools and
fountains are intrinsic parts of an Islamic garden.

The Gardens
Then it’s time to step outside into the two distinct
gardens, a traditional Islamic garden and a smaller
exotic garden, with plants from all over the world.

The Islamic garden links the two riad buildings
and is laid out along strict geometric lines, with a
four-part structure surrounded by walkways tiled in
bejmat (terracotta bricks) and green zellige, and a
series of water channels, pools and fountains. This
layout, found in Morocco since the 12th century,
represents heaven and is considered a sacred space.
It certainly is a peaceful spot, full of birdsong,
olive and citrus trees, grasses and flowering plants,
making it an ideal respite from the busy medina

You’ll need a special ticket to visit the tower at the

aged six and up.

Musée de la Musique
If you’d like to know more about Moroccan classical music, this
is the place to come. Concerts are held three evenings a week
at the Music Museum (adult/child Dh60/free), also known as
the Musée de Mouassine. It is a gasp-worthy example of the
exquisite domestic decoration of the Saadians.

PLANNING TIP
To attend a
concert, time
your museum
visit for late
afternoon to
coincide with the
concert starting
time of 7pm.

An Amazing Find
While house-hunting in the medina, Parisian Patrick
Menac’h stumbled across a historic treasure of great
cultural significance. Beneath the layers of white
plaster of a modest riad’s 1st-floor douir (guest apartment) was a jewel of domestic Saadian architecture
from the 1560s that he set about restoring.
Imagine the delight of travel-weary guests of old
as they entered the main salon with its symphony
of colour: verdigris and apricot climb the walls in
a vertical garden, while bedrooms are trimmed
with sculpted Kufic script framed by azure blue
and finished with a fine Pompeian red skirting. You
might think the vivid colours on show are the work
of the 24-person restoration team, but the decor is,
amazingly, original – its vibrancy preserved beneath
layers of plaster for centuries. In the side salon, you
can view a fascinating short video of some of the
restoration methods.

The riad’s ground-floor rooms hold a small collection
of Amazigh artefacts, musical instruments and
temporary photography exhibitions, but concerts
are held in the intimate upstairs salons: Andalusian
music on Mondays, Amazigh on Wednesdays and
gnaoua on Fridays. Book online; tickets include
entrance to the Maison de la Photographie (p87).
Climb up to the rooftop, where there’s a small cafe.

Dar El Bacha

MAP P64 A2

The Palace
Built in 1910, Dar El Bacha (the Pasha’s House) has
been beautifully restored and is one of the medina’s
finest examples of riad architecture. Wander
through the walkways around the central courtyard
with its orange trees, flowers and fountains, past
round columns covered in zellige and topped with
carved plaster and cedarwood lintels. The six salons
surrounding the garden host exhibits featuring
different facets of Moroccan culture, including
ceramics, jewellery, brassware and items from the
three monotheistic faiths.
In the outbuildings is a traditional hammam,
an apartment for palace servants, a library and the
private harem reserved for the Pasha’s family.

The Pasha
All this sumptuousness gives you a glimpse into
the world of fabulously wealthy Moroccan warlord
Thami El Glaoui. Pasha of Marrakesh (1912–56), El
Glaoui hailed from Kasbah Telouet in the High Atlas
Mountains. He was one of the world’s richest men
and loved the high life, building this magnificent residence as well as Palais Glaoui in Fez. But he collaborated with the French occupiers and, when they left
in 1956, his family fell out of favour. It’s all brought to
life in Gavin Maxwell’s Lords of the Atlas.

to build the most beautiful houses

-cherifa; @darcherifaoffical) is typical of the 17th-century architecture
found in this neighbourhood.
It’s a dar, meaning a traditional
house, rather than a riad (which has
a garden in the central courtyard)
and is typical of the architecture
found in this neighbourhood, built
with comfort and luxury in mind. It
was restored by Abdellatif Aït Ben
Abdallah, whose passion for Marrakchi heritage has seen him restore
several medina riads, including the
1112 Marrakech (p91) teahouse.
Today Dar Cherifa is a café
littéraire, or cultural centre and
restaurant. It hosts international
and national exhibitions and is a
venue for seminars and concerts.
Find out what’s happening on its
Instagram page.
True to the original function of
traditional medina houses, it is a
haven of peace, providing great
relief from the bustling activity of
the souqs all around it. The rooftop
is a perfect spot for afternoon tea.
The courtyard restaurant serves
traditional Moroccan cuisine combining Amazigh, Arab-Andalusian
and Jewish fare.

classy local designers have set up
shop too.
Two cafes overlooking the

restored, Hammam Mouassine
(hammammouassine.ma) has
charming and professional staff
who will wash you and then scrub
you down (known as a gommage)
with Morocco’s famed kessa glove
until you’re super clean (Dh170).

This is one of the few public
hammams with English-speaking
reception staff, who will furnish
you with a bag for your belongings
and a disposable mitt for your
hammam. Men enter the hammam
through the marked archway on
the western side. The women’s
entrance is through the signposted
alleyway, Derb El Hammam, on the
east side (the same street as Musée

Choose from a traditional
hammam (Dh170) or a relaxing

Original public bathhouses, mostly with separate times for men and women,
are the cheapest option. Take your own exfoliating glove, olive soap, towel and
spare underwear, and hire an assistant if you want to pay a bit more. Some cater
for tourists and supply everything. Some riads have their own hammams, often
just big enough for a couple. They provide massages too. You’ll need to book in
advance. Luxury hotels usually have a full spa with a hammam and provide all
the beauty treatments you’d expect, such as various types of massages, facials
and waxing. Book in advance.

THE MAKING OF MARRAKESH
The Amazigh Sanhaja tribe founded the Almoravid dynasty in the 11th century and
swept through the south of Morocco. They pitched their campsite on a desolate
swath of land that would become Marrakesh. Leader Youssef ben Tachfine
recognised its strategic potential, and built ramparts around the encampment in
1062 CE, and established the city’s khettara (underground irrigation canals) and
signature pink mudbrick architecture. Ben Tachfine launched successful military
campaigns securing Almoravid control of Andalucía and Marrakesh became the
operational centre of an empire that stretched right up to Barcelona’s city limits.

the staging post for medieval
merchants selling sugar and tea,
but today the courtyard chambers
are filled with small shops selling
spices, cosmetics and argan oil.
It’s particularly noteworthy for the
red-ochre geometric decoration
of diamonds, hexagons and stars
that border its internal stone
arches.
Some of Marrakesh’s fanadiq
are named after the activities that
once took place within, as is the
case with Funduq El Mizen (MAP:
a P64 E2) – mizen means scales in
Arabic, and this is where traders
would have come to weigh goods
for sale. Today it houses small
artisan workshops, but amid the
craft products there’s still a giant
set of rusting metal scales.

EXPLORE

Fanadiq (inns once used by caravans – the singular is funduq) once dotted the
important stopover towns on caravan routes across the Sahara to Morocco.
Since medieval times, these creative courtyard complexes provided groundfloor stables and workshops, and rented lockable rooms for desert traders and
travelling merchants upstairs. From this flux of artisans and adventurers emerged
the inventive culture of modern-day Marrakesh. As trading communities became
more stable and affluent, though, most fanadiq were gradually replaced with
private homes and storehouses. Some 140 fanadiq remain in the medina, most of
them now restored and housing artisans and shops.

KÂAT BEN NAHID & BAB DEBBAGH

Along with Mouassine, Kâat Ben Nahid is the heart of the old
medina, with scrawls of close-knit alleyways hiding 17th-century
riads. It’s home to the Musée de Marrakech, the Ben Youssef
Mosque and its magnificent medersa (Quranic school). The
mosque is one of the most important in Marrakesh, and the
oldest, completed in 1132. The district’s several museums
include the Maison de la Photographie, with its old photos of
Marrakesh.
Further east, the neighbourhood is simply home to local
people going about their lives. Stalls selling clothes sit next to
others hawking oranges, butchers’ shops and hole-in-the-wall
restaurants. At the eastern edge, skins are cured at the Bab
Debbagh tanneries.

Getting Around
Walk
Walk east from Dar El Bacha or north through
the souqs from Djemaa El Fna in about 10
minutes to reach this area. The first route is
safer at night.
Once in the neighbourhood, the going is flat,
but, as ever, it’s cobbled and you must beware
of the pesky motorbikes. Ave Bab Debbagh
is wide, but the streets become narrower and
busier around the Ben Youssef Mosque.
Taxi
Ask for Place El Moukef for Kâat Ben Nahid,
or Bab Debbagh for the tanneries.

Ben Youssef Medersa
‘You who enter my door, may your highest hopes be exceeded’
reads the inscription over the entryway to the magnificent
Ben Youssef Medersa (adult/child under 12 Dh50/10), and
after almost six centuries, the blessing still works its charms
on visitors. This former Quranic school is Marrakesh’s most
important historic monument.
MAP P82 C2

PLANNING TIP
The earlier you
visit (it opens at
9am), the quieter
the medersa will
be. Large tour
groups descend
on it from midmorning. Expect
to spend about
an hour here.

Courtyard
Step from the street under a porch of muqarnas,
decorative honeycomb-like plaster vaulting, and
through massive doors covered in carved bronze.
Then, emerging from the relative darkness of the
entry hall through mashrabiya (latticed) doors, it’s
difficult to suppress a gasp of astonishment at the
serene beauty of the courtyard with its sensational
decoration. At 15m x 20m, the expanse is a relief
after the tiny streets of the medina outside.
A large pool is set in the marble floor, surrounded by channels that keep the water flowing. The
water for this central pool and the hammam is kept
moving by pipes at different levels. Don’t miss the
cutaway in the vestibule wall that shows how the
ingenious ancient water system works. The CGI
movie at Le Jardin Secret (p66) in Mouassine
explains this ancient hydraulic system further.

Decoration

Scan this QR code
for information about
the medersa and its
restoration.

In the courtyard, the walls and columns are covered
in zellige (colourful geometric mosaic tilework), with
friezes of calligraphy above, then intricate stucco
carving – look out for the Saadian-era pine cones
and palm trees carved into the plaster. All of this
is topped by carved cedar wood. The muqarnas on
the domed ceiling in the prayer room opposite the
entrance are particularly beautiful, and the mihrab

Students’ Lodgings
Students came from all over North Africa to study
the Quran, Islamic law, algebra, literature, history
and science at this, the most important medersa
in Morocco, and the largest in the region. With
130 rooms, the medersa accommodated up to 800
students in dorms arranged on different levels
around the main courtyard and around six smaller
courtyards open to the sky to provide light.
The ablution room on the ground floor has four
marble columns and a domed ceiling over a central
water basin and surrounding latrine rooms (today
transformed into modern toilets for visitors).

Almoravid Koubba
Climb down the steps to discover the pretty Almoravid
Koubba (adult/child Dh100/20), Marrakesh’s oldest building.
Recent restoration has revealed it to be a sophisticated
900-year-old ablution complex for an adjacent mosque.
MAP P82 B3

PLANNING TIP
Some readers
feel the entrance
fee is too high,
given you’ll
spend about 15
to 20 minutes
here. You can
just look at the
Koubba from
the surrounding
railings, but
you’d miss
the exquisite
decoration inside
the dome.

History
The conquerors of the Almoravids, the Almohads,
destroyed almost everything their predecessors built
in Marrakesh, but somehow overlooked this graceful
12th-century pavilion and koubba (dome) across
from the Ben Youssef Mosque. It is thought to have
been the ablution centre serving the original mosque,
known as the Almohad mosque. The remains of a
minaret can be seen nearby.
The Koubba subsequently disappeared under the
outbuildings of the Ben Youssef Mosque built in the
14th century, and was only excavated in 1952. The
whole complex has recently been restored.

Architecture & Decoration
The Koubba’s design reveals what Hispano-Moorish
architecture owes to the Almoravids: keyhole arches,
interlaced arabesques and a domed cupola on a
crenellated base, similar to domes found in Córdoba
and Toledo.
The dome covers a pool used for ablutions before
prayer. Outside the building, khettaras (traditional
underground irrigation systems) supply latrines and
drinking water taps. Inside, the pavilion and dome
are richly decorated with floral patterns, calligraphy
and exquisite muqarnas. The arches around the
inner edge are decorated in red and sandstone stars.
Another rectangular building adjacent to the
Koubba has three bays containing fountains that
likely supplied water to the local population.

Vintage Portraiture
The ground-floor courtyard and rooms fanning off it
are usually devoted to portraiture. The subjects are diverse, from tribal tattooed women of the mountains to
aristocratic Arab city dwellers from Fez. The stand-out
image of the permanent collection is a mesmerising
photo of Hamidou Laambre, a sub-Saharan servant,
taken in 1885 by Arévalo, a librarian from Tangier.

Morocco’s Photography Debut
The ground floor’s back salon holds the gallery’s oldest
photos, showing the debut of photography in Morocco
when the first Europeans arrived with cameras and
began documenting life here. The exhibit includes
images of Tangier taken between 1870 and 1900.

Landscapes & Lifestyles
The 1st-floor chambers host engaging works by Hungarian Nicolas Muller (1940s) and Belgian Charles
Henneghien (1960s). Don’t miss the 1920s photos
of the Saadian Tombs, Ben Youssef Mosque, Djemaa
El Fna and Marrakesh’s ramparts, with only empty
desert stretching beyond.

DON’T MISS
The rooftop
terrace (p93), one
of the highest in
the medina, has
a cafe providing
a welcome break
– and splendid
views – after your
visit to the gallery.

Collectors of vintage Moroccan photography Patrick Menac’h and

at the porch and enormous brass
doors of the Ben Youssef Medersa

school is Marrakesh’s most significant monument.

Enter the medina through handsome Bab Debbagh and immediately you’ll see the tanneries on
your left. If you feel robust enough
to endure the constant haranguing

to see how the skins are cleaned. It’s
free to enter. Don’t be lured into any
shops or the Artisanal Centre. Continue along Ave Debbagh, passing
Clinique du Ballon, where soccer
and rugby balls are hand-stitched,
on your right. There are some smaller tanneries you can poke your nose
into along here. You’ll see normal
medina life going on, with men
tending tajines in tiny restaurants,
women making msemen (fried flatbreads) on griddles, children going
to school and people doing their
shopping at small vegetable carts
and butchers’ shops.

Men have been up to their knees
in lime, pigeon poo and other
smelly substances at the Bab
Debbagh Tanneries (closed
Friday) since the late 11th century.
Skins are brought here to be
cured in the vats of chemicals to
remove the hair, softened so they
can be cut and stitched, and dried
in the sun. It’s a vast area of vats
and smells pretty bad, but it’s
interesting to see the men at work
and a good photo opportunity.
Unlike the Chaouara tanneries
in Fez, the leather is not dyed
here, so the vats are not vibrantly
coloured.
You probably won’t need more
than 15 minutes here. Plan your
visit for the morning before the
sun makes the smell worse. Be
aware that it’s free to enter and
you don’t need a guide, despite
what the faux guides (unofficial
guides) outside tell you.

Spend an hour gawping at the
decadent salons of the Mnebhi
Palace housing the Musée de
Marrakech (marrakechmuseum.
com; adult/child Dh70/20). The
central courtyard, with its riot
of cedar archways, enormous
chandelier, stained-glass windows,
intricately painted door panels
and, of course, lashings of zellige,
is the highlight, though don’t
miss the display of exquisite Fez
ceramics in the main room, and
the palace hammam. This is one of
Marrakesh’s oldest museums and is
looking dated compared with some
others.
The cafe in the entrance
courtyard makes a welcome break.

The Centre Artisanal Medina off Derb Soussane in the vicinity of Bab Debbagh
should be avoided. Readers have complained of being lured in and not being
allowed to leave until they give a tip or buy something they don’t want. Prices are
high and the men are aggressive. Others wait outside and demand money for a
tour of the tanneries. If you’re not sure you’ll be able to shake off these men, go in
a group or with a registered guide organised through your accommodation. Note
that this does not apply to other artisanal centres dotted about the medina.

Dwaz Atay at 11am served with
pastries, or any time for a good

Kasbah & Mellah

KASBAH & MELLAH

When the Almoravids founded Marrakesh in 1062, this was
where they set up camp. A kasbah is a fortress erected for the
glory and protection of warmongering sultans. The Royal Palace
is still here, along with Badi Palace, the Bahia Palace and large
riads for wealthy courtiers. The imposing El Yazidi Mosque is
second only to the Koutoubia, and sultans were buried in the
nearby Saadian Tombs. In the 1550s, Sultan Abdallah Al Ghalib
moved the Jewish population to the Mellah, next to the kasbah.
Several synagogues were built, and the oldest, El Azama, is still
in use, as is the nearby Jewish cemetery.

Getting Around
Walk
Once in the neighbourhood, you’ll be on
foot. Rue de la Kasbah is a wide, open street,
but the deeper you go into the Kasbah or
the Mellah, the smaller the cobbled streets
become. It’s a 15-minute walk from Djemaa
El Fna to the Mellah through Riad Zitoun. For
the Kasbah, it’s a 20-minute walk.
Taxi
Ask for Rue Bahia Bab Mellah, or Bab Agnaou
for the Saadian Tombs.
Calèche
For a scenic option, hire a horse-drawn
carriage.

Bahia Palace
It’s not Marrakesh’s oldest palace, but the Bahia (adult/child
under 12 Dh100/30) – meaning beautiful – is definitely one of
the city’s most eye-popping sights, an 8000-sq-metre floor-toceiling extravagance of intricate marquetry, plasterwork and
zouak (painted wood), built by Grand Vizier Si Moussa in the
1860s. Plan on an hour or so here.
MAP P96 D2

PLANNING TIP
Tour groups
descend
throughout the
day, so come for
opening or later
in the afternoon.
Allow plenty of
time so that you
can pause and
wait for passing
groups to
dissipate.

98

-kasbah-mellah-pk-mar7-output.indd 98

Petit Riad

Closest to the entrance, the single-storey Petit Riad
has walls of intensely elaborate white plasterwork,
inscribed with verses from the Quran. In the 19th
century, when it was originally decorated, this
plaster would have been carved in situ while wet
– just imagine the artisan skill required to work so
swiftly and accurately.
This area of the palace was a later addition, built
when Si Moussa’s son and successor Bou Ahmed
became Grand Vizier in 1894, and was where he
would have received government officials. After
Morocco became a French protectorate in 1912, the
Petit Riad was used as the private apartments of
French Resident-General Lyautey when he was in
Marrakesh; he added electricity and heating.

Cour d’Honneur
Sandwiched between the Petit Riad and the Grand
Riad, the Grand Cour, or Cour d’Honneur, is the
undisputed heart of the palace – a spectacular open
space of 1500 sq metres, restored to its original
brilliance in 2018. The floor is a vast expanse of Italian
Carrara marble, encircled by a gallery coloured with
bright blue and yellow plaster and woodwork.
When Bou Ahmed expanded the palace,
this section was converted into a harem for his
four wives and 24 concubines.

Grand Riad
Step through the doorway from the Cour d’Honneur
into the lush fountain courtyard of the Grand
Riad. This is the oldest part of the palace complex,
completed in 1867 by Si Moussa, a former enslaved
man who rose through the ranks to become one of
Sultan Hassan I’s most important aides. The riad’s
salon is bedecked with carved wood lintels, zouak
artistry and stained-glass detailing – Bahia Palace
was thought to be the first building in North Africa
to use stained glass as a decorative feature.
Despite the vast area on show, only a portion of
the palace’s 8 hectares and 150 rooms is open to the
public. Its grand spaces still play host to important
cultural events today.

COFFEE STOP
Right opposite
the entrance
to the Palace
is Beldi Fusion

TO P E X P E R I E N C E

Saadian Tombs
Sultan Al Mansour was as extravagant in death as he was in
life. After the ‘golden king’ built Badi Palace in the 16th century,
he transformed an existing necropolis into this lavish tomb
complex (adult/child under 12 Dh100/20). You can gawp at the
splendour in about half an hour.
MAP P96 A4

PLANNING TIP
Visit in the
afternoon to
avoid big tour
groups and often
long queues
to view Al
Mansour’s tomb.
The entrance
is through the
archway directly
opposite the
Kasbah Café.

Chamber of 12 Pillars
Saadian Sultan Al Mansour spared no expense
on his tomb, importing Italian Carrara marble
and gilding honeycomb muqarnas (decorative
plasterwork) with pure gold to make the Chamber
of 12 Pillars (pictured), a suitably glorious
mausoleum. Al Mansour died in 1603, and some
decades later, Alaouite Sultan Moulay Ismail walled
up the Saadian Tombs to keep his predecessors out
of sight and mind. It was the French who opened
them up again in 1917, after spotting them on an
aerial photograph.
The tomb complex’s main chamber is to the left
of the site entrance – just look for the queue. It can
only be admired through an arched viewing door,
though plans are afoot to build a viewing platform
circling the chamber to help ease congestion.
Elaborate zellige (colourful geometric mosaic
tilework) and the gilded muqarnas abound in
this hall, and the cupola ceiling is supported by 12
pillars of Carrara marble. Two of these columns are
noticeably older – they were plundered from the
ancient Roman city of Volubilis.
Late afternoon is the best time for photography as
the marble work takes on a golden hue in the light.

in the Chamber of the Three Niches, while the
room to the left was originally a prayer room. The
intricately carved, pentagon-shaped feature in the
back wall is the mihrab (prayer niche).

Mother’s Tomb

This mausoleum was erected in 1557 and predates
the rest of the complex. Al Mansour claimed it for
his mother, Lalla Massouda, who lies in the singular
tomb recessed in a niche at the back of the mausoleum; the rest belong to other important women of
the court.
Next to this structure is the original main
entrance to the tombs, blocked up by Moulay Ismail.
Accessible for centuries only via the Moulay El
Yazid Mosque, the tombs were neglected until the
French rediscovered them and built the entrance
visitors now use.

KASBAH & MELLAH

Begin in the Mellah, a tightly packed old Jewish quarter. From
the pretty Place des Ferblantiers, visit the Saadian Tombs and
Badi Palace. You’re next in the Kasbah, where the Monde des Arts
de la Parure will impress you. Following the walls of the Kasbah
mosque, you’ll soon reach the Saadian Tombs, then Cafe Clock.

2 Prettiest Square

3 Saadian Palace Ruins
Continue to the end of Rue de
Berrima and turn right into the entrance to the Badi Palace (p104),
ruins of a monumental palace
complex of the Saadian Sultan Al
Mansour. Don’t miss the dungeons
and the minbar (pulpit) of the
Koutoubia Mosque kept here.

4 Fabulous Jewellery
Once you’ve finished at the Badi
Palace, retrace your steps to the
roundabout and take the next left,
Rue Tougma. At the T-junction,
turn left into Ksibat Nhass and
follow this street round the curve
until you reach Monde des

-kasbah-mellah-pk-mar7-output.indd 103

5 Ornate Tombs
On exiting the museum turn right
and walk to the next corner, turning right (this is still Ksibat Nhass)
and right again. You will soon be
walking along the well-restored
northern walls of the Moulay El
Yazid Mosque (also known as the
Kasbah Mosque). When you reach
the main road, Rue de la Kasbah
(with vehicular traffic), turn left
and walk along the eastern wall
of the mosque complex. When
you reach the end of the mosque
walls (the Kasbah Café is directly
opposite), enter the small archway
on the left into the Saadian
Tombs (p100), the fantastical final
resting place of the Saadian Sultan
Al Mansour, who built the Badi
Palace.

KASBAH & MELLAH

On exiting the synagogue, turn
right and walk north along Rue
Manchoure. Turn left onto Rue
Bahia Bab Mellah, a wider street.
Continue along this street with the
walls of the Bahia Palace (p98) on
your right. At the roundabout take
the first left into Rue de Berrima.
Place des Ferblantiers (p104)
will be on your left; check out the
last few metalworkers (ferblantiers
means tinsmiths), the spice and
homeware shops and the cafes
surrounding this pretty square.

Arts de la Parure (Jewellery
Museum; p105). Cross the moat
at the entrance and explore this
magnificent riad museum.

Begin at the El Azama Synagogue
(p105) in the Mellah. Still in operation, this is a fascinating slice of
Jewish history in Marrakesh.

6 Onto the Clock
After visiting the tombs, turn left
and continue walking south along
Rue de la Kasbah for 1.4km (20
minutes). After Parapharmacie
El Hadbi on your left, the road
curves to the left, but continue
straight here into Derb Chtouka
and Cafe Clock (p104) is on your
right. Time your visit for one of the
Clock’s evening music sessions and
enjoy something to eat on the roof
terrace.

Be Impressed by the
Badi Palace Ruins

ARCHITECTURE

MAP: 1 P96 C3
The scale of the ruined,
16th-century Badi Palace (adult/
child Dh70/300) built by Sultan
Al Mansour is remarkable; mooch
around it for an hour or so. All
you’ll see now are enormous walls
topped with storks’ nests, and
the remains of extensive gardens
around a central courtyard with
water channels and fountains. It
had some 300 rooms embellished
with gold and treasures brought
along the trans-Saharan trade
routes.
Descend into the dungeons
where the Sultan kept his prisoners,
and there’s an exhibition room
on the far eastern wall where a
CGI film shows what the palace

ENJOY PRETTY PLACE
DES FERBLANTIERS
Lovely Place des Ferblantiers
(MAP: 3 P96 D3) was once home
to tinsmiths, giving it its name.
It still has a few shops where
metalworkers make lanterns,
lampshades, bathroom basins
and interesting metal art. Many
shops now sell spices and natural
remedies, and there are some
homewares stores. Restaurants
spill out onto the square, making it
a good place to refuel.

once looked like. A highlight is
the intricate Koutoubia minbar.
If you’re curious about the
craftsmanship within Marrakesh’s
mosques but can’t see inside
them, pay it a visit. The minbar’s
cedarwood steps with gold and
silver calligraphy were the work
of 12th-century Cordoban artisans
headed by a man named Aziz –
the Metropolitan Museum of Art
restoration revealed his signature.

Soak Up Some Culture
at Cafe Clock

CAFE

MAP: 2 P96 B7

Sister to the Fez original, Cafe
Clock (cafeclock.com) is housed
in an old school with sunset
views over the Kasbah from its
rooftop. The food, including veggie
options like the falafel super
bowl and vegetable bastilla, is
decent – tourists delight in the
signature camel burger. However,
its popularity rests on its packed
calendar of cultural performances,
which also attracts many young
Marrakchis.
As well as ad hoc art exhibitions
and live Amazigh and gnaoua
concerts on Saturday and Sunday,
respectively, Cafe Clock hosts
weekly sessions of hikayat
(oral storytelling), inviting local
storytellers to weave their magic in
a mix of Darija and English.
The cafe also runs a variety
of cultural workshops. Sign up
for a 101 session on Marrakchi

come from all over the world to
find family members (the website
helps with this). When visiting,
men are given a yarmulke to wear,
and it’s customary to wash your
hands at the fountain – and tip the
guardian – before leaving.

Only a couple of synagogues in the
Mellah, out of an original 35, are
still used by Marrakesh’s dwindling
Jewish community, including this
one, El Azama (jmarrakech.org;
donation Dh10), which doubles as
an interesting museum of Jewish
life in Morocco. It was originally
built in 1492 by Jews expelled from
Spain, but this blue-and-white
interior is a much later iteration.
The synagogue is on the right-hand
side of the pretty internal courtyard
– note the Star of David motif in
zellige.

Step over the moat into the impressive Monde des Arts de la Parure

by the superb displays of jewellery,
saddlery, adornments, textiles and
ceremonial garments from around
the world. Nearly 3000 pieces
from more than 50 countries are
professionally curated and expertly
lit. Displays carry a QR code to scan
so that all is explained in English
and French on your phone. There’s
a rooftop restaurant, as well as a
gift and bookshop, so you’ll need at
least an hour here.
Once two riads, the museum
has been completely rebuilt using
traditional bricks and cedarwood
lintels. The hexagonal central halka
(ceiling aperture) surrounded by
black-painted mashrabiya (lattice)
is extraordinary.

BAB DOUKKALA & RIAD LAÂROUS

When you arrive at Bab Doukkala, you can see it’s a local area
with few tourists. Through the gate is a wide square revealing
everyday Marrakchi life: oranges and breakfast patisserie piled
high on carts, a fried-fish place and plenty of butchers.
The important 16th-century Bab Doukkala Mosque has been
well restored. Just south of its fountain, look for cooks making
warqa (filo-like pastry) to create the gossamer-thin sheets for
bastilla (sweet-savoury pies). This district has several upmarket
riad guesthouses, and the delightful Musée du Parfum in Riad
Laârous. To the north is the fascinating flea market of Souq El
Khemis.

Getting Around
Car & Taxi
Vehicular access in this area is good. Dar El
Bacha on Rue Dar El Glaoui is a convenient
taxi drop-off point. For the flea market, ask
the taxi driver for Bab El Khemis.
Bus
Take Bus 1 from Djemaa El Fna to Place Bab
Doukkala.
Walk
Once in the neighbourhood, you’ll be on foot.
The going is flat, mostly with cobbles underfoot. From Dar El Bacha, head northwest up
Rue Fatima Zahra for Bab Doukkala, or north
up Rue El Glaoui for Riad Laârous.

Take the left fork and continue

interesting shops such as designer
Akéwa Tribes Gallery (p117). Take
the next turning to the right into
Derb Sidi Ali Ben Hamdouch,
follow the twists and turns to
Les Jardins du Lotus (p116), an
excellent lunch stop.

EXPLORE

Bab Doukkala is the main gate to
the northwestern medina. The dogleg inside the gate offered greater
defence and visitors couldn’t escape
paying a toll. Erected around 1126, it
was the main gate for the Doukkala
tribe from the plains between
Marrakesh and Casablanca. Once
through the gate, turn left, then
right onto Rue Bab Doukkala, full of
street-food options.

Walk northeast across the square,
turn right onto Rue El Gza and
immediately left into Trik Jazouli.
Follow this street for 140m, then
turn right into Rue Ank Jemel.
Continue for 200m then turn right
into Rue Diour Saboun. After 240m
turn right again and the Musée
du Parfum (p115) will be on your
right. Book ahead if you want to
make your own perfume.

7 Chrob ou Chouf Fountain
Exit the museum, retrace your
steps to Rue Diour Saboun and
turn right. After 120m you’ll
see the tall Chrob ou Chouf
Fountain (p114) on the wall to
your left.

CYCLING & YOGA

Dutch-funded non-profit Pikala
Bikes (MAP: 1 P110 D6; pikalabikes.
com; 3hr tour adult/child
Dh280/150) is a community
project on a mission to get young
Marrakchis to ditch motorbike
aspirations in favour of good,
old-fashioned cycling. Group
cycling tours depart from its Riad
Laârous garage most mornings
at 9.30am and afternoons at 3pm
and include a backstreet tea break
and interesting cultural insights.
Proceeds pay to train young men
and women as mechanics or
professional tour guides.

A DROP TO DRINK
Marrakesh’s medina is dotted
with public water fountains, but
the UNESCO-listed, 16th-century
Chrob ou Chouf (Chrab wa Chouf)
Fountain (‘Drink and Look’; MAP:
5 P110 E6) still holds on to shreds
of former finery with its intricately
carved cedar-wood lintel. Unlike
many others, the fountain is still
used and you’ll likely see passing
pedestrians stopping for a quick
drink as you admire the artistry.
Underground channels supply
water to the fountain in the same
way as at Ben Youssef Medersa and
Le Jardin Secret.

delicate petals. Other rooms cover
topics such as hammam rituals,
the cosmetic benefits of argan and

aromatherapy, herbs and spices in
Moroccan culture. If you’re into
things olfactory, you can create your
own perfume at the remarkable

massive cedarwood doors that

Gueliz & Ville Nouvelle

GUELIZ & VILLE NOUVELLE

If the medina is medieval madness, Gueliz is all about glamour
with a touch of 1930s style. The heart of Marrakesh’s Ville
Nouvelle has wide boulevards, plenty of parks and stylish
apartment blocks, but the original French art deco villas, hotels
and cinemas are fast disappearing. Numerous galleries showcase
contemporary artists, chefs use superb local produce to conjure
up a modern riff on Moroccan cuisine, and cafe culture abounds.
The sublime Jardin Majorelle and dazzling Musée Yves Saint
Laurent Marrakech lie just northeast of Gueliz. On the city’s
northern edge is the Sidi Ghanem zone of designer outlets, and
the Palmeraie has art museums in large gardens.

Getting Around
Walk
To reach Gueliz, walk from the medina in 30
minutes. The Ville Nouvelle is flat and fairly
easy to get around on foot.
Taxi
A petit taxi from the medina costs around
Dh15 to Gueliz. Getting to the Jardin Majorelle
and Musée YSL from the medina costs about
Dh25. Getting back is more expensive: taxis
wait at the nearby rank and charge at least
Dh50 back to the medina.
Bus
Bus 1 from Arset El Bilk goes to Gueliz from
the medina, or you can take a calèche (horsedrawn carriage).

Jardin Majorelle
The Jardin Majorelle (adult/child under 10 Dh150/free, incl
Musée Pierre Bergé des Arts Berbères Dh230/free, incl Musée
YSL Dh330/free) is an iconic symbol of Marrakesh. Despite
its popularity, its walkways and pools through tall palms,
whispering bamboo and cacti of every shape retain a sense of
serenity. The excellent Musée Pierre Bergé des Arts Berbères is
located in the garden, as well as a cafe, shop and bookshop.
MAP P120 G1

PLANNING TIP
Tickets for your
time-sensitive
visit are available
online only.
Jardin Majorelle
opens at 8.30am;
go as early as
possible to avoid
the crowds and
summer heat.

Scan this QR code for
full opening hours and
to book ahead.

The Garden
As you walk around the garden on its crisscrossing
red paths, you’ll see the soaring palm trees, the
flowering plants, the corridors of tall bamboo, the
prolific birdlife and the remarkable collection of
cacti, planted with plenty of space around each one
so that each plant can be appreciated individually.
There’s a rill leading to a reflecting pool under a
graceful gazebo, and other pools stocked with fish
(pictured). The buildings are painted that bright
Majorelle blue, with yellow accents. It’s true there
are a lot of visitors, but get your timing right and
you can soak up the light and tranquillity of the
garden to your heart’s content.
Jardin Majorelle is thronged by almost a million
visitors a year, making it Morocco’s most popular
tourist sight. It’s far from the peaceful oasis it was
a decade ago, but it’s still an extremely stylish place
with magical gardens, art deco architecture and an
excellent museum.
The garden and museum are fully accessible for
wheelchair users.

How the Garden Was Saved
The garden was first opened to the public in 1947
when Jacques Majorelle found the upkeep too

expensive, but was then abandoned after his death
in 1962 until Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé
made it their mission to save it.
The French couturier and his partner had a house
in Marrakesh and loved to visit the garden. When
they learned that it was up for development, the
pair bought the property in 1980 and converted
Villa Oasis into their home. Since then, the garden
has been restored, and many new plants have been
added.

Plant Species
The garden is home to more than 300 plant species
from five continents, mostly collected by Jacques
Majorelle over several decades of globetrotting.

useful illustrations to help visitors identify
everything from Mexican agave to Chinese windmill palms and North African date palms. A team

Villa Oasis Gardens

In 2018 the Villa Oasis gardens opened to the
public for the first time. Accessed via a pathway
draped with bright bougainvillea and distinct from
the main gardens, they are arguably the more
sumptuous and engrossing of the two and have
greatly enhanced the visitor appeal of the complex.

plants and gardens published by the Majorelle
Foundation as well as other books on Morocco.
Then there’s a shop that sells YSL’s Love Postcards,
stylish accessories, pots of blue paint so you too
can have a bright blue planter, and teas from
Moroccan Botanist (p78).

Yves Saint Laurent Memorial
One of the most popular spots in the garden is
the memorial. Find it along the back wall on
the opposite side of the gardens to the entrance/
exit. If you can block out the photographers and
Instagrammers, it’s a poignant space. The memorial
is an ancient Roman pillar, which Yves Saint Laurent
and Pierre Bergé found on a beach in Tangier.
Bergé was added to the memorial after his death in
Provence, France, in 2017.

Who Was Jacques Majorelle?
Invited to visit by the resident governor, General
Lyautey, the young French Orientalist painter
Jacques Majorelle was enthralled by the sights,
the light and the exoticism of Morocco. In 1924,
Majorelle bought some land just outside Marrakesh
and built his family home among the palms and
poplar trees. The house was painted the bright hue
that is now known as Majorelle blue, inspired by the
bold Moroccan skies, the shade of blue in traditional
Moroccan tiles and the head-turning blue veils of
the Tuareg people in the southern Sahara.

the Fondation

RIAM (Network of
Agroecological

For almost 40 years, Majorelle painted, contributed to architectural projects such as Hotel La
Mamounia (p56), raised a family and planted his
garden with exotic specimens from all over the
world. Two of his large paintings of Marrakesh can
be seen at the Musée du Patrimoine Immatériel
(p47) on Djemaa El Fna.

Fondation Majorelle
The non-profit foundation was established in 2001
by Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Bergé and Madison
Cox to safeguard the Jardin Majorelle, Musée
Pierre Bergé des Arts Berbères and Musée Yves
Saint Laurent Marrakech. It provides training in
garden-related subjects and museum curatorial
services, finances scholarships, provides grants to
cultural and educational institutions and organises

Award-Winning Architecture
The first thing you notice on arrival at the museum
is the remarkable architecture of the building: the
terracotta bricks are locally made in Marrakesh’s
red ochre colour. These bricks form a lattice-like
facade that reflects the warp and weft of threads,
and contrasts with the smooth lower facade like
lace meeting silk. The curved and straight lines of
the building are reminiscent of a drape of fabric.
Opened in 2017 in homage to the couturier who so
loved Marrakesh, the museum has won awards for
its architecture.
Step inside and it’s a complete contrast, with a
silky smooth finish intended to complement the
exterior like the lining of a couture jacket.
The museum was designed by Studio KO and
was the brainchild of Yves Saint Laurent’s partner
Pierre Bergé (1930–2017), who wanted to create a
repository of the fashion designer’s work that was
‘profoundly Moroccan’. To this end, the building
was designed without external-facing windows, to
emulate Marrakesh’s traditional riads.

COFFEE BREAK
My Kawa (p139;

Rue Yves Saint
Laurent is the
perfect spot for
coffee or ice
cream after your
museum trip and
before hitting
the trendy shops
along this street.

Like a traditional house of the medina, internal
patios are an integral design feature of the
museum. The first is a striking circular walkthrough that segues between the entrance and
internal exhibition spaces. Here a series of
stained-glass windows echoes the work of French
artist Henri Matisse, who greatly influenced
YSL’s designs. The second patio forms the heart
of the building, a square chamber covered with
zellige (mosaic tilework) and a giant circular dish
that catches the rain. The use of green here is
significant, as it’s highly prized in both Amazigh
and Islamic cultures.

The Algerian-born French fashion designer
(1936–2008) was fascinated by the artistry and
colours of Morocco, which continued to inspire
him throughout his life.
The core of the museum is the Yves Saint
Laurent Hall, holding a permanent display of
his sketches, rotating haute-couture fashions
and colour-themed accessories. The backdrop
is entirely black – a key colour in YSL’s designs
– creating a cavernous cocoon pierced only by
audiovisuals of the designer’s catwalk shows and
recordings of him speaking.

Designer Homewares at Sidi Ghanem
About 20 minutes’ drive northwest of the city is the
industrial quarter of Sidi Ghanem. Unprepossessing it might be, but it does house dozens of interior
designers and artists who have large showrooms.
Here you’ll find contemporary artist Hassan Hajjaj
and his quirky teashop, designer LRNCE, and furniture and homewares outlets such as Chabi Chic.
Prices are fixed and credit cards are widely

WO RT H A T R I P

Wave goodbye to the Marrakesh medina and unwind in the
lunar-like landscape of stony desert framed by spectacular High

excursion, come for the evening for a starlit dinner, or overnight
in luxurious tents.

Bike Morocco
(mtbmorocco.

Green Wheels
(marrakech
greenwheels.com).

Agafay’s apparent remoteness and barren, lunar
landscape make it perfect for quad biking, dune
buggies and camel riding. Note that while quad
biking is popular in Morocco’s desert landscapes,
there is ongoing discussion of the noise pollution
and ecological damage it creates.
Camps have sprung up throughout Agafay,
providing a sense of adventure alongside accommodation in luxurious, safari-type tents, yurts or
geodesic domes. Agafay makes a great break from
the frenetic intensity of Marrakesh, offering a taste
of desert life without the long journey to the Sahara
(a minimum of 450km best done over two days).
Come for the day to enjoy the rides and the
landscape, have lunch, relax around the pool
or take a yoga class. Some camps have a party
atmosphere in the evenings and offer dinner,
stargazing and music. To sample all the activities,
stay for a night or two in luxurious tents.

How to Choose Your Camp
The camps offer luxurious glamping – tents come
tastefully furnished and have a private bathroom
and viewing platform. In winter, staff will light
your wood-burning stove while you’re having

Nkhila Lodge (nkhilalodge.com) is great for
children, with a kiddies menu and family tents

FAMILY TRAVEL

TOOLKIT

Family Travel
Moroccans are inherently family-oriented. They’ll scoop up
your offspring and feed them sweets, smile indulgently as kids
play, and then invite you for Friday couscous. Old-fashioned
family values thrive here, and children are viewed as a blessing.
Feeding the Family

Kids with adventurous palates will enjoy a streetfood adventure (p45), devouring maâkouda
(fried potato patties), grilled merguez (spicy
sausage) sandwiches and spicy babbouche
(snails). Classics like harira (a hearty soup), kefta
(meatball) and egg tajine or plain couscous often
please fussier tummies. Less daring eaters will
find plenty of familiar favourites, including pizza,
pasta and wonderful ice cream.

Getting Around

Petits taxis can only take three people, and
baby counts as one; a grand taxi might be preferable.
The horse-drawn calèches make a fun way to get
around; pick one up at Arset El Bilk near Djemaa El
Fna. Call a tuk tuk (p29) when small legs are tired.
Pushchairs are impractical in the medina; bring a
backpack or sling.

LETTING OFF STEAM
Marrakesh has
several green spaces
for kids to run around.
Close to Djemaa
El Fna are the
Koutoubia Gardens
(p51), and Cyber Park
is northwest of the
Koutoubia. They’re
all free of charge, but
keep off the
grass!

Avoid the
Crowds

Early mornings are
quieter in the souqs,
meaning less hassle
and a better view of
craftspeople at work.

Admission Fees

Monuments and museums
are often free for
children, or have much
reduced rates.

-section-3-pk-mar7-output.indd 144

Medina Outings

Take the kids on palace jaunts, splash in garden
fountains, and pause for freshly squeezed juices on
cafe rooftops. From 6pm to 8pm is the best time for
Djemaa El Fna dance troupes and musicians.

Allergies & Intolerances

People with food allergies and intolerances
won’t have a problem in midrange and high-end
restaurants, though allergens are rarely listed on
menus. Book online, if possible, when you can list
your requirements. Be more vigilant in cheaper cafes
and restaurants where concepts such as gluten-free
or vegan are not as well known.
HOW TO SAY

WATER
You will automatically be brought water when you order coffee in a cafe. If it’s a
glassful, avoid it, as it will be tap water. When you order water with a meal, it will
be mineral water and you will be asked if you want sparkling or still.

Alcohol

146

Most places do
not serve alcohol. If they
do, the server will bring
a drinks menu listing
spirits, cocktails and
wines. The more upmarket the restaurant, the
more French wines will
be available. Because
most Moroccans do not
drink alcohol, there’s
usually a wide range of
mocktails on the menu.

-section-3-pk-mar7-output.indd 146

HOW Pay the Bill
TO… In most restaurants or cafes, you ask

the server for the bill and pay them.
Occasionally (for example, at Cafe Clock), you will
need to pay at the reception desk.
Credit card You can pay by card in more upmarket
places.
Split the bill You can ask to split the bill if necessary.
Tipping If you just have a drink in a cafe, a few
dirhams will suffice. In restaurants, a tip is sometimes
included, so check the bill. If it’s not included, 10% is
sufficient. If you pay by card, remember to give the tip
in cash; you can’t add it to the card payment.

TOOLKIT

LGBTIQ+ Travellers
Morocco continues to criminalise same-sex relationships,
despite advocacy efforts. Public attitudes remain conservative,
and discretion is advised.
Current Situation

Morocco’s laws and societal norms pose
challenges for LGBTIQ+ travellers, though the
country’s rich culture and hospitality remain appealing.
Attitudes vary – foreign-owned hotels tend to be more
welcoming, while some locally run establishments may
be far more conservative. Public LGBTIQ+ spaces are
scarce, and there are no official Pride events, though
discreet communities exist. Be aware that public
displays of affection – regardless of orientation – are
discouraged. Morocco ranks poorly on global LGBTIQ+
travel indexes, reflecting ongoing legal and social
challenges.
Despite its conservative mindset, Morocco can
still make an unforgettable trip for LGBTIQ+ travellers. A spirit of tolerance is increasingly the norm. Be
mindful of the cultural differences and remember
that you are a visitor in someone else’s home.

Bag Snatchers

Wear a bag across your
body to avoid snatching
by pillion riders in the

Tips for Solo Women Travellers

Dress modestly. Take taxis at night. Eat
in places busy with locals or frequented by
international residents. Choose accommodation
where you can relax and retreat. Seek out female
guides. If someone is uncomfortably persistent, do
not engage. Stay calm, move away and look around
for help; it’s never far away.

HEALTH & SAFE TRAVEL

TAP WATER
According to
standards set by
the World Health
Organization and the
Moroccan Ministry
of Health, tap water
is considered safe to
drink in Marrakesh
and other major
cities. However, if
you’re not used to it,
it’s better to stick to
bottled water.

Buying travel insurance for medical care
and accidents is essential in Morocco. You’ll
have to pay upfront for emergency healthcare,
whether it’s an upset tummy or something more
serious, so make sure you’re covered. Coverage for
delays, cancellation, luggage loss and theft is also
recommended. Health insurance cards from the UK,
EU and USA are not valid.

It’s illegal to use
cannabis recreationally
in Morocco.

TOOLKIT

Responsible Travel
Follow these tips to leave a lighter footprint, support local and
have a positive impact on communities.
Overtourism

Bottlenecks of tour groups at Marrakesh’s top sights are
often poorly managed and put stress on the city’s historical
heirlooms. Stray off the tourist path and visit some of
Marrakesh’s excellent, smaller museums and attractions.
Consider an early morning visit to the Jardin Majorelle
(pictured) to beat the crowds: it opens at 8.30am. Tickets
are only available online for the garden and neighbouring
Yves Saint Laurent Museum.

Pedal Power

Hire a bike from Pikala Bikes (p114), which
trains young people to become professional
cycling tour guides and bike mechanics. Or choose
Marrakech Green Wheels (marrakechgreenwheels.
com), which teaches children to ride bikes.

Local Support

Stay in small riads in the medina that
employ local people, and buy local goods and
services. Buy from women’s cooperatives or
use the tuk tuk (p29) service that employs
vulnerable women, those with disabilities and
women from rural areas. Have lunch at Amal
Center (p137) in Gueliz, a non-profit organisation
that supports vulnerable women and trains them
in restaurant skills.

Climate Change & Travel

It’s impossible to ignore the impact we have when travelling; Lonely Planet
urges all travellers to engage with their travel carbon footprint, which will mainly
come from air travel. While there often isn’t an alternative, travellers can look to minimise the number of flights they take, opt for newer aircrafts and use cleaner ground
transport, such as trains. One proposed solution – purchasing carbon offsets – unfortunately does not cancel out the impact of individual flights. While most destinations
will depend on air travel for the foreseeable future, for now, pursuing ground-based
travel where possible is the best course of action.
The UN Carbon Offset Calculator shows how flying impacts a
household’s emissions.
The ICAO’s carbon emissions calculator allows visitors to
analyse the CO2 generated by point-to-point journeys.

ACCESSIBLE TRAVEL

TOOLKIT

Accessible Morocco

Accessibility remains something of a work in
progress. The medieval medina and riads riddled
with staircases pose challenges for those with
mobility issues, though modern hotels are generally
fairly well equipped. Infrastructure for visually and
hearing-impaired travellers is also limited, and solo
female travellers may attract curiosity/unwanted
attention.

City Transport

Buses and taxis are not wheelchair accessible,
though a grand taxi does offer more space. Tuk Tuk
Marrakech (p29) is a useful option to get to and from
destinations deep in the medina. Drivers carry a step
to make getting in and out easier.

ACCOMMODATION
Many Ville Nouvelle
hotels have adapted
rooms, lifts to
upper floors and
restaurants at ground
level. Staying in a
medina riad might be
possible if it has flat
access points and
rooms around the
courtyard.

Marrakesh
Magic

Marrakesh is mostly flat,
making it easy to roam
the medina and access

sights, such as the
Saadian Tombs, Bahia
Palace and Ben Youssef
Medersa.

Smoking

Type E

Smoking and vaping are very common in
Morocco. Nearly 25% of men smoke, and young
men and women in cool Marrakesh and Casablanca
hangouts are likely to be puffing away. Smoking inside
many bars and restaurants is still allowed, but is
banned in taxis and on public transport.

DARIJA
Moroccan Arabic (Moroccan Darija) is a descendant of
both classical and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) that
has undergone a lot of linguistic change due to the free
borrowing and loan blends from several languages,
especially French. This is the everyday spoken language
you’ll hear when in Morocco. Here, we’ve represented
the Moroccan Darija phrases with the Roman alphabet
using a simplified pronunciation system.

LANGUAGE

There are three main dialects among Tamazight
speakers, which in a certain sense also serve as loose
lines of regional demarcation.

TAMAZIGHT
GLOSSARY
Hello. La bes darik/
darim (m/f).
Hello (response).
La bes.
Goodbye. Akayaoon
arbee.
See you later.
Akranwes daghr.
Please. Barakalaufik.
Thank you.
Barakalaufik.
Yes. Yah.
No. Oho.
Excuse me. Samhiy.
How are you?
Meneek antgeet?

Good. Eefulkee/
eeshwa.
Bad. (Khaib)
eeghshne.
Food. Teeremt.
Somewhere to
sleep. Kra lblast
mahengane.
Water. Arman.

TOOLKIT

The main language in Morocco is Arabic, which
is used throughout the country. The standardized
version of Tamazight is codified by the Royal Institute
of Amazigh Culture. The main dialects are spoken
in the Sous region, the Atlas and Rif Mountains and
the surroundings of northern Morocco. French is still
regularly used in the cities.
