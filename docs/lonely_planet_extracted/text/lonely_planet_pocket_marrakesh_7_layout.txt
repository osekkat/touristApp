             PLAN YOUR TRIP
                              Any time is a good time to visit Marrakesh, with the possible exception
                              of July and August, when temperatures soar to 50°C or more.
                              End-of-year holidays are peak season, when many riads and hotels ask
                              for a minimum of three to five nights’ stay. It might be chilly, but it’s
                              warmer than Europe and skies are usually blue. Easter and All Saints
                              (end October) are also peak times, when European schools are on holiday.



             WHEN TO GO
                              Spring (March–May) and autumn (September–October) are busy, and the
                              weather is perfect. The summer months of July to August have extreme
                              temperatures and you’ll need to stay hydrated and out of the sun.

                   Pavements are cobbled with the odd pothole; wear sturdy shoes.
                   Watch out for speeding motorbikes. Gueliz is laid out like a European
                   city, with pavements for walking, but they can be uneven here, too. Be
                   careful crossing roads, as drivers don’t necessarily stop at crossings.

                   Roll up, roll up: if there’s one thing you can’t miss in Marrakesh,
                   it’s the reeling, free-wheeling circus that is Djemaa El Fna. By
                   day, piercing flutes and drums provide the soundscape, while
                   street vendors peddle incense and spices, fruit-juice stands
                   tout for business, shops display more baskets than you’ve ever
                   seen and motorbikes zoom round the edges. At night, hordes of
                   hungry revellers come to feast at food stalls and be entertained
                   by musicians and performers. Heading south, the parallel Riad
                   Zitoun streets and surrounding alleyways are crammed with
                   interesting shops.

                    and artisans from his home studio at what is now Jardin Majorelle (p122). For the

                                 the hotel’s Majorelle Suite features a portrait of the artist.

                   The lanes that spool north from Djemaa El Fna sum up the
                   push and pull between the old and the new in Marrakesh. This
                   atmospheric area is home to the city’s biggest concentration of
                   souqs and qissariat (covered markets). You could spend a whole
                   morning exploring the spice shops around Rahba Kedima. In
                   artisan areas such as Souq Haddadine and the fanadiq (inns),
                   metalworkers clang away.
                     Mouassine has a fresh breed of Mediterranean-inspired
                   rooftop restaurants breathing fresh life into the ancient streets.
                   Dating from the 16th-century Saadian period, this wealthy area
                   had grand homes, and at the centre is the beautifully restored
                   Mouassine mosque.

                   Getting Around
                   The best route north from Djemaa El Fna is
                   to take Souq Semmarine up to Place Rahba             T H E B E ST
                   Kedima and beyond.

                   There is no car access through the souqs.
                   The most convenient drop-off gateways are        HISTORIC SQUARE Place
                   Bab Laksour and Dar El Bacha.                      Rahba Kedim (p72)

                   Beyond the gateways you’ll be on foot in this
                   neighbourhood. Fortunately, it’s flat, but the      Mouassine (p73)
                   pavements are cobbled so be sure to have          MUSEUM Musée de la
                   suitable footwear. This is an ancient area and       Musique (p68)
                   streets are very narrow and get busy. Look
                   out for motorbikes.

                                         The Amazigh Sanhaja tribe founded the Almoravid dynasty in the 11th century and
                                          swept through the south of Morocco. They pitched their campsite on a desolate
                                             swath of land that would become Marrakesh. Leader Youssef ben Tachfine
                                         recognised its strategic potential, and built ramparts around the encampment in
                                          1062 CE, and established the city’s khettara (underground irrigation canals) and
                                          signature pink mudbrick architecture. Ben Tachfine launched successful military
                                          campaigns securing Almoravid control of Andalucía and Marrakesh became the
                                          operational centre of an empire that stretched right up to Barcelona’s city limits.

                     floor stables and workshops, and rented lockable rooms for desert traders and

                    the inventive culture of modern-day Marrakesh. As trading communities became

                   Along with Mouassine, Kâat Ben Nahid is the heart of the old
                   medina, with scrawls of close-knit alleyways hiding 17th-century
                   riads. It’s home to the Musée de Marrakech, the Ben Youssef
                   Mosque and its magnificent medersa (Quranic school). The
                   mosque is one of the most important in Marrakesh, and the
                   oldest, completed in 1132. The district’s several museums
                   include the Maison de la Photographie, with its old photos of
                   Marrakesh.
                     Further east, the neighbourhood is simply home to local
                   people going about their lives. Stalls selling clothes sit next to
                   others hawking oranges, butchers’ shops and hole-in-the-wall
                   restaurants. At the eastern edge, skins are cured at the Bab
                   Debbagh tanneries.

                   When the Almoravids founded Marrakesh in 1062, this was




                                                                                                   KASBAH & MELLAH
                   where they set up camp. A kasbah is a fortress erected for the
                   glory and protection of warmongering sultans. The Royal Palace
                   is still here, along with Badi Palace, the Bahia Palace and large
                   riads for wealthy courtiers. The imposing El Yazidi Mosque is
                   second only to the Koutoubia, and sultans were buried in the
                   nearby Saadian Tombs. In the 1550s, Sultan Abdallah Al Ghalib
                   moved the Jewish population to the Mellah, next to the kasbah.
                   Several synagogues were built, and the oldest, El Azama, is still
                   in use, as is the nearby Jewish cemetery.

                   When you arrive at Bab Doukkala, you can see it’s a local area
                   with few tourists. Through the gate is a wide square revealing
                   everyday Marrakchi life: oranges and breakfast patisserie piled
                   high on carts, a fried-fish place and plenty of butchers.
                     The important 16th-century Bab Doukkala Mosque has been
                   well restored. Just south of its fountain, look for cooks making
                   warqa (filo-like pastry) to create the gossamer-thin sheets for
                   bastilla (sweet-savoury pies). This district has several upmarket
                   riad guesthouses, and the delightful Musée du Parfum in Riad
                   Laârous. To the north is the fascinating flea market of Souq El
                   Khemis.

                    If the medina is medieval madness, Gueliz is all about glamour

                    with a touch of 1930s style. The heart of Marrakesh’s Ville
                    Nouvelle has wide boulevards, plenty of parks and stylish
                    apartment blocks, but the original French art deco villas, hotels
                    and cinemas are fast disappearing. Numerous galleries showcase
                    contemporary artists, chefs use superb local produce to conjure
                    up a modern riff on Moroccan cuisine, and cafe culture abounds.
                    The sublime Jardin Majorelle and dazzling Musée Yves Saint
                    Laurent Marrakech lie just northeast of Gueliz. On the city’s
                    northern edge is the Sidi Ghanem zone of designer outlets, and
                    the Palmeraie has art museums in large gardens.

                    the light and the exoticism of Morocco. In 1924,
                    Majorelle bought some land just outside Marrakesh
                    and built his family home among the palms and
                    poplar trees. The house was painted the bright hue
                    that is now known as Majorelle blue, inspired by the
                    bold Moroccan skies, the shade of blue in traditional
                    Moroccan tiles and the head-turning blue veils of
                    the Tuareg people in the southern Sahara.

                          Climate Change & Travel
                          It’s impossible to ignore the impact we have when travelling; Lonely Planet
                   urges all travellers to engage with their travel carbon footprint, which will mainly
                   come from air travel. While there often isn’t an alternative, travellers can look to min-
                   imise the number of flights they take, opt for newer aircrafts and use cleaner ground
                   transport, such as trains. One proposed solution – purchasing carbon offsets – unfor-
                   tunately does not cancel out the impact of individual flights. While most destinations
                   will depend on air travel for the foreseeable future, for now, pursuing ground-based
                   travel where possible is the best course of action.
                   The UN Carbon Offset Calculator shows how flying impacts a
                   household’s emissions.
                   The ICAO’s carbon emissions calculator allows visitors to
                   analyse the CO2 generated by point-to-point journeys.
